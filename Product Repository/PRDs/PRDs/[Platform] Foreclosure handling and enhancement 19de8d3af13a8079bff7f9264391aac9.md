# **What problem are we solving?**

The Reserve bank of India asks us to round off [due](https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/Scripts/CustomerServiceGuidelines.aspx#:~:text=00%2F2006%2D07dated%20July%201,the%20next%20higher%20rupee%20and) amount for the user to the nearest integer. However our LMS tracks all transactions up to 2 decimals. 

Link to guideline by RBI: [https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/Scripts/CustomerServiceGuidelines.aspx#:~:text=00%2F2006-07dated July 1,the next higher rupee and](https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/Scripts/CustomerServiceGuidelines.aspx#:~:text=00%2F2006%2D07dated%20July%201,the%20next%20higher%20rupee%20and)

To handle the same scenario we will be rounding the foreclosure amount as per the following logic.

If foreclosure amount is less than N.50 (where N is an integer) should be rounded of to the lower integer (xx), and amount equal to or greater than xx.50 should be rounded to N+1

While amounts can be rounded off to the lower or higher integer, the backend calculation will still be in 2 decimals. This requirement covers the corresponding requirement for the same.

# **How do we measure success?**

Objective:

- Compliant collection processes for the NBFC

Subjective:

- Foreclosure collection amount and actual foreclosure amount should be stored
- Rounded off value for foreclosure should be stored at a request level so that we can measure the rounded impact (up (positive) and down (negative)) in collections

---

# **How are others solving this problem?**

- Credit card providers do not round off outstanding amounts and collect amounts up to 2 decimals
- TCL deducts mandate presentation amounts up to 2 decimals, however amounts less than 1 Rs are collected or amounts less than 1 Rs are pending for collection, the same are realised as miscellaneous profit or loss
- BFL rounds up amounts and accounts it (How they account it is something that is unclear)

---

# **What is the solution?**

We will be rounding up or down the foreclosure amount based on the half even rounding strategy where:

- If due amount at the time of foreclosure is more than or equal to N.5 it will be rounded up to N+1
- If due amount is less than N.5 it will be rounded down to N

The same will be passed on to the LSP as foreclosure amount. When the user makes the corresponding payment, we will collect it and accept the foreclosure request.

There can be two corresponding cases post the transaction is posted into the loan account:

- Account is in excess of an amount less than 1 Rs
- Account has an outstanding of an amount less than 1 Rs

**Scenario 1:**

Post collection of the foreclosure amount, we will be doing an excess refund with a transaction type: Round up adjustment

**Note:** No payout will be initiated in this scenario and only a payout transaction will be posted into the loan account with the corresponding transaction type.

Payment type to be passed: “Excess round adjustment”

Against this excess payment we will be setting custom accounting entries with Finflux which will look something like as follows:

Dr: Excess COA (Liability) GL ₹0.76
Cr: Round off adjustment COA (Liability) GL ₹0.76

These ledgers will be then tracked for balance, and when this amount becomes significant they will be donated to the government and will be moved out of the liability for the NBFC.

**Scenario 2:**

Post collection of the foreclosure amount, we will do a repayment equal to the outstanding balance. Now there can be multiple scenarios here

The transaction type passed would be “Repayment round adjustment” and will follow corresponding accounting entries

Charge due (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Fees receivable GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

Principal outstanding (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Loan portfolio GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

Interest due (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Interest receivable GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

Charge + interest due (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Interest receivable GL + Fees receivable GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

Principal + charge due (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Loan portfolio GL + Fees receivable GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

Interest + principal outstanding (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Interest receivable GL + Loan portfolio GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

principal + interest + charge due (less than 1 Rs)

- CR: Loan portfolio GL + Fees receivable GL + Interest receivable GL
- DR: Round off adjustment COA

**Note:** There will not be any actual collection against this settlement and accordingly no UTR
