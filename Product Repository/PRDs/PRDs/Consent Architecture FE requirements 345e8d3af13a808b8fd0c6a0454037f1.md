# **What problem are we solving?**

In reference to the recent RBI Digital lending guidelines directions (2025)as well as TRAI regulations , DSP need to capture few additional consents from the customer in the lending journey to be compliant .Following are the guidlines that shaped these consent requirements

1. Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Companies – Credit Facilities) Directions, 2025 (Digital Lending)
2. Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018.
3. Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 & its Rules. (This will be effective from May 2026, so currently not being emphasized)

## User stories / User flow

DSP Consent requirements

***KYC context screen (applicable across all Volt platforms)***

On the KYC context screen, need to support a explicit  consent checkbox (unchecked) with the following verbiage for capturing the required 4 consents (ie 3P data sharing, KYC data sharing, Credit bureau pull, T/C& privacy policy)

*Verbiage:I agree to the [T&C](Consent%20Architecture%20FE%20requirements%20345e8d3af13a808b8fd0c6a0454037f1.md) & [](Consent%20Architecture%20FE%20requirements%20345e8d3af13a808b8fd0c6a0454037f1.md)[Privacy Policy](https://dspfin-assets.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/pdfs/privacy-policies/privacy-policy-27-03.pdf) of DSP Finance, allow them to share my data with Third Parties listed in the Privacy Policy, fetch credit bureau details for underwriting & KYC details from UIDAI/CKYC.*

b)Additional details screen (mandatory consent)

This screen already captures 2  diff consents but the following changes need to be made to these:

- Verbiage changes: Existing consent verbiage to be updated to reflect the below text
    - Consent 1: I declare I am an Indian resident, & agree to inform DSP finance if there is change in this status.
    - Consent 2:I here by confirm that address fetched from KYC records is my current & permanent address
- Checkbox is currently pre-checked and needs to be unchecked by default, going forward

~~Volt consent requirements (TBC with BE)~~

~~Currently in the B2B2C customer register flow, no consent is taken from the customer wrt Volt T&C and privacy policy. We need to capture the below consent in the same flow:~~

~~Verbiage:*I agree to the [T&C](https://voltmoney.in/terms?showHeader=false) and [privacy policy](https://voltmoney.in/privacy?showHeader=false)*~~
