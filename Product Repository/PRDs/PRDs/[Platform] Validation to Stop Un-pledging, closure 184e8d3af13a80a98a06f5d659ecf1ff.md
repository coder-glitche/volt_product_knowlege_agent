# **What problem are we solving?**

Account freezing or suspension is a temporary restriction that prevents an account holder from accessing specific or all account features. This occurs for several reasons:

- Suspicious activity detection
- Policy violations
- Payment issues
- Security concerns

We have the operations team, and risk team who can place an account under suspension or frozen state. 

The frozen state **ALSO** occurs when an active account undergoes foreclosure procedure so as to prevent the user from initiating any debit transactions while the account closure is in process.

Freezing an account help us complete processes and investigations on LMS side. During this period, the user should be able to do only specific activities for specific types of freezes. 

We are solving the problem of un-lodging and foreclosure of account after manual freezing which is possible right now because we have no validations differentiating different reasons of freezes.

---

# **Why are we solving this?**

We freeze accounts manually for flagging and investigating cases of suspicious activity as well as credit risk. If users are able to un-pledge and foreclose in this freeze state it will lead to financial and/or regulatory risk. 

---

# **How do we measure success?**

- 100% accurate reason-based processing
- Zero incorrect un-pledging and foreclosure allowances

# **What is the solution?**

We will be adding some validations to stop foreclosure and un-pledging of the manually frozen accounts.

The foreclosure check will include:

1. If the account is active/expired, freeze it and continue the foreclosure process
2. In case if an account is frozen before the initiation of the foreclosure by the user, it has to be rejected.

The un-pledging check will include:

1. If the account had been frozen, don’t go forward with the un-pledging
2. If is active, then continue with the pledging

## User stories / User flow

---

The maker (Risk team, Operations team) placed a freeze on an active account and needs to add the valid reason for the same from the drop-down. The following are the options for the reasons which need to presented to the user:

1. Suspicious Activity
2. Invalid collateral addition or valuation
3. Incorrect Repayment addition
4. Invalid bank account

Categorising the above issues into 2major categories:

1. Foreclosure
2. Other reasons:
    1. Suspicious Activity
    2. Credit Risk includes:
        1. Invalid collateral addition or valuation
        2. Incorrect Repayment addition
        3. Invalid bank account

All frozen accounts have the same kind of validations required and thus, validations for a frozen as have been made uniform.

Following are the checks and responses to be followed one-on-one case basis

| Activities | Frozen State Validations |
| --- | --- |
| Withdrawal | Not Allow |
| Repayments | Allow |
| Addition of funds | Not Allow |
| Un-lodgement | Not Allow when it is user generated. Allow this when it is within the foreclosure job. |
| Fore-closure | Not Allow |
| Excess | Stop the Auto-Excess payout function. This should not affect the excess-repayment in the foreclosure flow |
| bank account update | Not Allow |
| charges and penalty | Allow |
| Phone number update | Not Allow |
| email ID update | Not Allow |
| sell-off | Not Allow |
| Enhancement | Not Allow |

Handling on Volt End:

- We need to add validation at request level
- If account is frozen then do not allow the below request
    - Withdrawal
    - Increase limit + margin pledge
    - Un-lien
    - Foreclosure
- Error message to show:
    - Header: Couldn’t process your request
    - Sub header: We’re unable to complete your request at the moment. Contact our support team for assistance
