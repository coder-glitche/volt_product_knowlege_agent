# **What problem are we solving?**

For PhonePe, we are creating a lead after the MFC fetch, but the customer name and email are not being pushed to LSQ. This makes it difficult for RMs to conduct sales calls effectively.

# **What is the solution?**

## Requirements overview

- We need to push customer name and email in MFC Fetch Activity
- When user click on continue button after the MFC fetch, we break portfolio into CAMS and KFIN and calculate values for both RTA. we need to trigger new activity to push the KFIN and CAMS eligible value.
- We only ask PhonePe user to refresh portfolio, if portfolio are refreshed then CAMS and KFIN value will pushed to CRM through existing Activity.
- We need to override customer name and email once primary borrower KYC is completed
