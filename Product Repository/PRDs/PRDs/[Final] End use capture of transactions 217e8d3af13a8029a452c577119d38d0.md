# **What problem are we solving?**

- As per RBI guidelines, lenders are required to record the end use of loan disbursements to prevent misuse or diversion of funds and to enable traceability of customer transactions if necessary. Currently, our system does not ask users to specify the purpose of withdrawals, which is a compliance gap.
- Additionally, capturing end use helps improve internal reporting and risk management.

---

# **How do we measure success?**

- 100% of disbursement transactions have a captured end use.
- Compliance checks related to loan usage pass without observations.
- Improved internal categorisation of loan disbursement reasons.
- The end use capture is RBI compliant

---

# **How are others solving this problem?**

---

- Most regulated lenders and NBFCs capture the end-use at the during loan applications (as most lenders offer term loan rather than credit lines & hence purpose of drawdown needs to be captured just once) via drop downs.

# **What is the solution?**

- **Capture end use during each withdrawal**
    - **Pros**: Enables granular tracking of the specific purpose behind each withdrawal, offering clear visibility into usage patterns.
    - **Cons**:
        - Complicates the mapping between repayments and disbursements, especially when multiple withdrawals have different declared purposes.
        - Involves higher development effort, as UI changes (e.g., dropdowns on withdrawal screens) would be required.
- **Incorporate tweaks in the end use declaration within the loan agreement [Prioritised]**
    - **Pros**: Minimal engineering effort, as no changes to withdrawal screens are needed.
    - **Cons**: Limits visibility into actual usage at a transaction level, which may reduce data fidelity for downstream analysis or compliance.
