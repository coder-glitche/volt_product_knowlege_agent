# **What problem are we solving?**

As per RBI’s KYC guidelines, if as an RE we are obtaining PAN of the customer the same should be verified from the issuing authority (as per point 10(j) of Chapter III in the RBI KYC [Masterdirections](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)). This means that PAN should be verified via the NSDL PAN verification API.

Currently we are not integrated with the NSDL PAN verification API, which makes us non-compliant. We need to plan and align on how to integrate NSDL PAN verification API across all LSPs. This document presents strategies that we can implement to ensure future (and backward) compliance along with their Pros and Cons.

Understanding of the regulation - 

Where PAN is obtained, the same shall be verified from the verification facility of the issuing authority. 

“Verification facility of the issuing authority” makes it very clear that the PAN obtained should be verified by NDSL. 

We currently obtain PAN of the customer either from Digilocker or get it verified via PAN verification API provided by Signzy

- PAN document obtained from Digilocker is an e-document that NSDL (or UTIITSL) has already cryptographically signed and published. Does obtaining this document suffices the “verification facility of the issuing authority”? This is not clear.
    - Digio mentions that this suffices the compliance requirement.
    - Protean mentions that this does NOT suffice the compliance requirement.
    - Hyperverge mentions that this is a gray area, few lenders don’t hit the PAN validation API and consider fetching PAN from Digilocker to be verification from verfication facility of the issuing authority.
        
        <aside>
        💡
        
        Considering Protean is the technical arm of NSDL, we should put more weightage on their recommendation. The final decision on the compliance validity of PAN downloaded from Digilocker depends upon internal policy. 
        
        </aside>
        
- For customers whose PAN document could not be fetched from Digilocker due to name/DOB mismatch issues (currently around 16% of our customers) we are NOT compliant as we have not verified their PAN from the verification facility of the issuing authority.
- If PAN is taken from customer, the same can be verified anytime before we setup an account based relationship with the customer. We do NOT need to verify the PAN as soon as we are obtaining it.
- For accounts that we have already opened, we should finalise if we want to verify their PAN via NSDL APIs or not.
    
    <aside>
    💡
    
    Once integrated with the NSDL PAN verification API, for active loan accounts: 
    
    - We should definitely verify all the PANs where PAN was verified by the Signzy API.
    - We can take a call to verify other PANs basis our decision on compliance validity of the PAN downloaded from Digilocker.

Solutions: 

1. Wait for CKYC to get completed and then make sure all LSPs integrate with with KYC v2 APIs. 
    1. Pros: 
        1. All the PANs captured post v2 integration with LSPs will be NSDL verified. 
    2. Cons:
        1. Integration effort for LSPs will be high
        2. Until they integrate we will not be compliant.
2. Create a wrapper NSDL PAN verifiaction API and make sure LSPs integrate the API and call the API once before agreement generation. DSP to store the NSDL PAN verification logs. 
    1. Pros: 
        1. Comparatively easy to integrate
        2. LSP has the flexibility to trigger this API wherever it suits them
    2. Cons:
        1. Integration effort.
        2. Error/edge case handling in case NSDL API is down. 
3. Trigger the NSDL API on DSP end before generating KFS. Name, DOB and PAN are already available to hit this API.
    1. Pros:
        1. No effort required from LSPs side
    2. Cons:
