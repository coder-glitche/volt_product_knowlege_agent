# **What problem are we solving?**

When a user makes repayment to their loan account for either part payment or foreclosing their account, or initiates a sell off there can arise scenarios where the user’s account goes into excess.
This excess if the account is not under foreclosure, is automatically refunded via a daily CRON job that identifies loan accounts in excess, and initiates a payout of an amount equal to excess to regularise the account.

However there can arise scenarios, where this amount is less than Rs 1, if such an amount is found in excess, the corresponding payout for the account fails, as Cashfree only supports payouts above Rs 1.

Currently, we will not be able to close loan account which are in the excess of an amount less than 1 Rs as, there is no way to regularise the account

---

# **How do we measure success?**

- Number of accounts foreclosed when they were in excess of an amount less than Rs 1

---

# **How are others solving this problem?**

- TCL absorbs amounts less than 10 Rs as either miscellaneous profit or miscellaneous loss (depending on if the account is in excess or shortage)
- BFL runs a CRON job to settle excess, and manually adds adjustments to knock off excess amounts below 1 Rs

---

# **What is the solution?**

We will be making enhancements in our excess job and foreclosure job to solve this problem:

- Excess job will only have accounts where excess amount will be greater than 1
- If an account has an active foreclosure request, or a pending disbursement, it will not be eligible for an excess refund and will be ignored in the excess refund job
- We will be creating transaction type “excess_adjustment” for excess refund transactions, the same will be passed as a type when doing a excess transaction
- We will be setting up transaction type accounting events for excess refund for two scenarios:
    - Excess refund below 1 Rs (liability transfer)
        - Excess COA (liability): Debit
        Excess refund liability: Credit
    - Excess refund above and equal to 1 Rs
        - Excess COA (liability): Debit
        - Loan portfolio: Credit

## User stories / User flow

This can arise for the following scenarios:

- Invocation request of amount more than the total outstanding was posted into the loan account, when this happens the particulars of the account will get settled in the following order:

Interest overdue → Charges overdue → Interest due → Charges due → POS → Excess

(if the transaction amount is greater than total outstanding = Interest overdue + charges overdue + interest due + charges due + POS, the remaining amount will flow in excess
- Rounding of due amount on the LSP side, there was a due of 115.7 for the user, the LSP collected and posted 116 Rs as a transaction for the user, an excess of 0.3 is created
- Foreclosure (Extra amount for interest accrued is collected from the user to account for future days (simulation) however loan account is closed earlier

When such scenarios arise:

- Excess of more than 1 Rs (if the account does not have a foreclosure request in progress) will get settled via the excess refund job
- Excess of more than 1 Rs (if the account has a foreclosure request in progress) will get settled via the excess refund step in the foreclosure workflow
- Excess below 1 Rs (if the account does not have a foreclosure request in progress) will be settled by making a transaction with the transaction type “excess adjustment” without actually creating a payout for the user

## Requirements

---

Excess refund workflow enhancements:

- Ignore accounts with an excess of less than 1 Rs for excess refund flow
- Ignore accounts with an ongoing foreclosure request (non terminal) in the excess refund workflow
- Ignore accounts with an ongoing disbursement request (non terminal) in the excess refund workflow

Excess refund transaction type in foreclosure requests:

- BRE to be set up to decide transaction type in the excess refund step in the foreclosure workflow
    - If amount is less than 1 Rs, excess_adjustment
        - Transaction remarks: Excess amount adjustment
    - If amount is greater than 1 Rs, excess_payout
        - Excess amount refunded to bank account number: {bank name} ****{last 4 digits of user bank}
