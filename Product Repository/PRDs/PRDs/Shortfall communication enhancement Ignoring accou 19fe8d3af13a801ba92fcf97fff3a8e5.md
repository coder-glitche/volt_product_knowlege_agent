# **What problem are we solving?**

A sell off is the process of invocation of a lien on a user’s security. That is when the lender or the pledgee, invokes their right to redeem the units of a security pledged by the user with the lender.

There are two types of sell off:

- Lender initiated sell off
    - Lender initiates sell off of securities to recover outstanding amount (30 DPD)
    - Lender initiates sell of to regularise the user’s loan account (shortfall)
- User requested sell off
    - User requests a sell off due to inability to fulfil their commitments towards the credit line

Lifecycle of a sell off request (TAT: 3-4 working days):

1. Sell of request is initiated by the lender (User request or collections)
2. Number of units against ISIN + Folio + Lien reference number combinations are are blocked in the LMS (This reduces the drawing power of the loan account to avoid duplicate requests)
3. Units are invoked with the RTA
4. RTA raises a redemption request to AMC
5. AMC processes the invocation and confirms to RTA with the transaction UTR 
6. RTA sends a report to lender with the UTR of the credit against sale of securities (Redemption transactions are at a Folio level)
7. Lender upon confirmation of credit, posts the corresponding repayment into the loan account of the user

This complete process can take 3-4 working days to process. While this is in progress there are multiple problem statements that are introduced:

Since blocking securities reduces/impacts DP, there can arise scenarios where post blocking the loan account goes into a state of shortfall (POS>DP) when an account goes into a shortfall (Regulatory) we send them communications however if the NBFC and the user has already requested for an invocation, they should not be technically considered in the communication job.

<aside>

Important: There can also arise scenarios where even after the settlement of the invoked securities the account remains in shortfall

</aside>

For now we are only keeping this as a check in the communications, however larger solutioning needs to happen in the shortfall logic (WIP) which will automatically ignore shortfall computation for accounts under sell off or any other special circumstances (Frozen for risk / etc)

# **How do we measure success?**

- Shortfall communications to the users should be accurate (How do we measure accuracy?)
    - Account shortfall eligibility: Accuracy of accounts that should be a part of shortfall communication
    - Shortfall ageing calculation: Ageing for shortfall calculation should be accurate
    - Shortfall amount: Shortfall amount calculation for the user should be accurate

# **What is the solution?**

We will be ignoring accounts under shortfall under the following condition:

V1: If an account has a non terminal collateral sell off transaction (hit collateral transactions API)

V2: If an account has an active sell off follow the following condition:

If Sum of all sale value of all collaterals ((Units blocked for sell off)*NAV(for corresponding ISIN at the time of raising sell off)) < Regulatory shortfall then include in the shortfall communication else ignore

## User stories / User flow:

Scenario 1:

User initiates voluntary sell off, securities are blocked for invocation (sell off) which reduces the DP of the user (Assume DP falls below POS) and account is in a shortfall state. Shortfall will start to accumulate with ageing however no communications will be triggered (for shortfall) to the user till the invocation repayments are posted into the loan account

If post repayment posting account is still in shortfall, shortfall calculation will initiate and will be communicated to the user (Scenarios may arise even after posting the invocation repayment, the account remains in shortfall)

Scenario 2:

NBFC initiates sell off for recovery of overdue

If account is in overdue, it is not necessary that post invocation the account goes into a shortfall however for this scenario let us assume that it does. When the sell off is initiated, DP will reduce below POS causing a shortfall. 

Shortfall calculation will be initiated in this scenario however communications will not be triggered to the customer
