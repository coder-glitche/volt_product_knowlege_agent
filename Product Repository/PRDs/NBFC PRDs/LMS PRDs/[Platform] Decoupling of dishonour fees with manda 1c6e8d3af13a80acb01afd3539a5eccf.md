# [Platform] Decoupling of dishonour fees with mandate presentation

Last Edited: June 27, 2025 8:44 AM
PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora
Status: Completed

# **What problem are we solving?**

Currently our dishonour charge application is coupled with mandate presentation, what that means is basis certain error codes that we get from Digio (presentation vendor), we either apply or do not apply dishonour charges

However that leaves the following gap, for customers where mandate was not registered, and presentation does not happen, we are not able to apply dishonour charges (which should have been applied).

How does scenarios arise where mandate is not registered for the user:

- User revokes existing mandate (cancels)
- User registers via Aadhaar Esign or Physical mandate which is either in a pending state (authentication successful but register success is pending) or in a failure state (Mandate registration failed)

---

# **How do we measure success?**

- Number of customers in overdue post 7th
- Number of customers for which dishonour fees was applied
- Dishonour charge coverage ratio (Number of charges applied for users with overdue / Total number of users in overdue)

<aside>
⚠️

Please note that dishonour fees is only applied for users where there is interest overdue and not charges overdue

</aside>

# **How are others solving this problem?**

- TCL and BFL apply mandate bounce charges (coupled with mandate presentation) and not overdue fees
- Other lenders, have automated jobs which identify (post EOD of due date) of customers in overdue and apply charges (as a job) for all of the customers

---

# **What is the solution?**

We will be setting up a job on Finflux which will apply dishonour charges (Rs 590 - - 500 + GST) to users with interest overdue on the 8th of next month (Interest for January was posted on 1st Feb and was due on 7th Feb, dishonour fees if applicable will be posted on 8th Feb at 2 AM)

We will remove charge application logic from our mandate presentation workflow, mandate presentation will only post or not post transactions based on the status received from the vendor (extendable to current implementation with PhonePe)

## User stories / User flow

- User had an interest accrued but not due of 100 Rs on Jan 31st
- Rs 100 accrued interest was posted as interest due on the 1st of February 2025
- User can either repay the amount by making a repayment to their loan account or wait till the amount is automatically deducted from their bank account via mandate presentation
    - User pays the amount via manual payment - Interest due is settled for the user
    - User does not make a repayment, amount is deducted via mandate and it settles the outstanding amount
    - User does not make a payment, mandate was registered and presentation was successful, interest gets settled
    - User does not make a payment, mandate was registered but presentation failed, user still has the option to make the payment on the 7th of next month (billing cycle)
        - If user makes payment (before 6 PM)- interest will get settled and there will be no dishonour charge implication for the user
        - If user does not make payment (before 6 PM) - interest will become overdue, and dishonour charges will be applied via an automated job on Finflux

## Requirements

Removing logic of dishonour charge application in the mandate presentation workflow:

- We will remove the logic of charge application in the mandate presentation workflow and the corresponding error handling
- Please note that the status, and reason for failure of presentation will still be stored in the DB

Changes in repayment posting BRE:

- Repayments made by users after 6 PM (post business hours) will be posted at 6 AM (please note that the charge application job will run at 4 AM on the 8th of every month, accordingly the transactions have to be posted post the job has to run to improve accuracy and apply charges to all accounts where dishonour fees should be applied.
