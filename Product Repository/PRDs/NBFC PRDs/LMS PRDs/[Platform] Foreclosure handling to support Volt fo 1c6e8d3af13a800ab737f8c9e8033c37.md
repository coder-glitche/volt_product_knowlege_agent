# [Platform] Foreclosure handling to support Volt foreclosure workflow

Status: Completed

# **What problem are we solving?**

A loan account has the following particulars:

- Charges due
- Penal charges due
- Interest due
- Principal oustanding
- Interest accrued not due
- Excess

Whenever a user makes a repayment, it goes through a set apportionment strategy:

Interest overdue → Charges overdue → Interest due → Charge due → Principal outstanding → Excess

Note that the repayments cannot settle interest accrued as it is not due, interest accrued is posted at the end of the billing cycle (becomes due) and then can be settled either via making repayments or via mandate presentation to the user’s loan account.

However there can arise scenarios where either the user, or the LSP would want to clear interest accrued at the time of making the repayment, one such use case is foreclosure where the interest accrued is settled within the billing cycle as a part of the foreclosure workflow of the NBFC.

Any amount paid more than the total due amount (Sum of all particulars minus interest accrued) is settled immediately, since repayments cannot settle interest accrued directly, the remaining amount is maintained in excess.

Another use case, that Volt (LSP) has is that they collect foreclosure request from the user and then try to retain the customer, in the current implementation, even if the complete amount is collected from the user but a foreclosure request is not raised, the excess amount will get automatically refunded back to the user.

---

# **How do we measure success?**

- Number of full settlement repayments received (type) from LSP

---

# **How are others solving this problem?**

Very niche use case (difficult to benchmark)

---

# **What is the solution?**

We will allow the LSP to pass an optional parameter called (Is foreclosure payment) in the create repayment order request.

<aside>
🚨

Please note that we will not be validating the amount (and if it satisfies foreclosure validations) for the account

</aside>

For this repayments, there will be an additional step in the payment workflow for the following validation:

- If Excess amount ≥ Accrued interest and TOS=0, clear dues
- If Excess amount < Accrued interest or TOS≠0 then do not clear dues

<aside>
⚠️

Please note that these payments will not go through a checker approval workflow

</aside>

## User stories / User flow

- User (via Volt) as an LSP raises a foreclosure request
- LSP passes this parameter in the foreclosure request
- If conditions are met, the repayment request clears all dues and settles the accrued interest for the user
- If conditions are not met, excess will be retained in the loan account and will be refunded back to the user in the next refund cycle (if excess amount >1)
- Volt internally tries to retain the customer (and not submit the foreclosure request):
    - Customer does not agree to not close loan account (Dues are already cleared, foreclosure request can be initiated without creating any new repayment order)
    - Customer agrees to not close account (Foreclosure request is never raised, account can be used as is)

## Requirements

**Modifications in create repayment order request:**

- LSPs will be able to pass a boolean value to describe if the created order is foreclosure payment
- Fenix will classify the corresponding repayment request with repayment mode “CLEAR_DUES” we will pass the same to finflux for an audit purpose
- Repayment mode to be passed to the LSP in webhooks

**Repayment workflow updates:**

- For repayments with repayment method “CLEAR DUES” we will hit the clear dues API based on the following validation:
    - If Excess amount ≥ Accrued interest and TOS=0, clear dues
    - If Excess amount < Accrued interest or TOS≠0 then do not clear dues
- Remaining steps remain the same for the workflow

Command centre changes:

- To give NBFC operations team context for such requests, we will start showing repayment method in the repayment requests section in the command centre @Karuna Sankolli (has the following possible values)
    - VIRTUAL_ACCOUNT
    - BANK_TRANSFER
    - PAYMENT_GATEWAY
    - MANUAL_TRANSFER
    - CLEAR_DUES
