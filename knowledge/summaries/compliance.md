## #4 — Credit Bureau Reporting Comms
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** March 19, 2026 11:57 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- DSP Finance is required by RBI regulations to report borrowers with outstanding interest dues to credit bureaus.
- Currently, **no communication is sent to borrowers at the time of reporting** — creating a regulatory compliance gap and leaving borrowers unaware of adverse credit events being filed against them.

- As reporting frequency increases from **2x/month (15th, EOM) to 4x/month (9th, 16th, 23rd, EOM) from July 1, 2026**, the gap scales without an automated solution in place.

## #5 — MNRL Compliance Validation Integration
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** April 29, 2026 5:11 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

---

- Currently, our system does not have a standardized mechanism to validate mobile numbers against authoritative revocation and risk datasets.
- This creates a gap where deactivated or reassigned numbers can still be used within onboarding and auth flows, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information (like OTPs) to unintended users.
- Additionally, numbers flagged by Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) for fraud or non-compliance may remain undetected, increasing the platform’s exposure to fraud risk and regulatory non-comp

**Solution:**

- We propose implementing MNRL validation at two critical touchpoints in the user journey to ensure early risk detection and strict compliance at the point of loan creation.
- Currently, mobile numbers appear in the MNRL dataset for multiple reasons. As part of the implementation, users will be blocked from loan account creation only for specific high-risk categories, based on compliance requirements.

## #6 — CKYC Comms for Regulatory Compliance
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** April 17, 2026 2:41 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Currently, DSP Finance (via Decentro) will search for an existing CKYC record in the CERSAI registry (using PAN) → if found, it downloads the data, compares it, and uploads any updates → if not found, it creates a new CKYC record.
- Regulatory compliance mandates that customers be notified when a CKYC record is created by DSP Finance.
- Currently, there is no automated mechanism to trigger an acknowledgement SMS to customers upon CKYC ID creation.
- Without this flow, DSP Finance risks non-compliance with RBI regulatory notification norms.

**Solution:**
?

**In scope:**
- Automated SMS trigger inline within the Decentro web-hook processing flow
- Per-record eligibility check (status == COMPLETED AND ckycReferenceId == null)
- Customer phone number resolution from internal system using fxcid_key
- Dynamo DB logging at per-record level for all outcomes (success, failure)
- Trigger Condition Logic
    - When Decentro’s bulk CKYC web-hook is received, the system insp

Any outsourced technology must comply with RBI guidelines. For cloud deployments, data ownership must remain solely with the RE, and all data—including video recordings—must be immediately transferred to the RE's owned or leased servers after V-CIP completion. Cloud service providers or third-party technology vendors must not retain any data from the V-CIP process. - ###
