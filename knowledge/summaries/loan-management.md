## 🟢 LATEST — Additional documents upload for Bajaj for AS ES DI
**Status:** Ready for Tech | **Last edited:** September 20, 2024 3:06 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

We are solving for autofilling these documents for the user and integrating them in the journey to improve the loan booking experience of joint holders of mutual funds.

Broadly, there are two ways to own a mutual fund:

1. Individual ownership (single account holder)
2. Joint ownership
    1. Joint (Approval of both parties is required) (2 account holders)
    2. Anyone or survivor (AS) (anyone can manage the account without seeking the other person’s approval) (up to 3 account holders)
    3. Either or survivor (ES) (both can manage the account without seeking other’s appr

## #2 — BAJAJ Dedupe API
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** September 12, 2024 5:02 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Users who have their lender assigned as BAJAJ (either through BRE or Hardcode) when have an already existing loan account with BAJAJ then we come to know about this only after the user has completed the application process. 

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will hit the BAJAJ dedupe APIs -  

1. At the step of lender assigning through BRE 
2. Whenever there is a lender change from TATA to BAJAJ through admin panel  

 Following are cases which we will consider - 

1. When the user comes to the “SET LIMIT PAGE” & “USER CONFIRMED THE LIMIT”, lender is assigned to the application either through BRE or it is hardcoded for various MFDs. 
    1. **In case of MFDs : (sending comms is de-prioritised as confirmed with Ranjan/Nishant, kindly ignore)**
        1. if BAJAJ is hardcoded, and there is a dedupe, then we’ll change the lender to TATA, while also sending the comms to the MFD. 
        2. The comms to the MFD will be, when we send the comms for application completed, we can also show :

## #5 — User getting stuck at KYC verification step in cas
**Status:** On Hold | **Last edited:** October 7, 2024 5:01 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In the applications in which we are not able to fetch PAN details, the user’s KYC is not getting verified via BAJAJ KYC_POD. 

---

**Solution:**
?**

- User completes the KYC screen :
    - We get “POV=null” in the getkycdetails response.
    - Then we will not keep the user stuck at this step, and allow them to move to the next “bank account” step.
    - Then we will enable the user to add supporting documents in the documents section
- When the issue is of mis-match, we will enable the 1st applicant to the add additional documents screen, where we will make the user attach the :
    - PAN signed document
- Once the user has uploaded the document, these documents will be sent in BAJAJ account creation mail, **(with remarks)**
    - **Remarks : “PAN for the customer was not fetched from Digilocker, hence attaching the self attested PAN of the user”**

## #7 — Multi Drawdown Term Loan LMS Requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 30, 2025 2:56 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

The existing OD-based Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) product does not align with the repayment expectations and financial behavior of a large segment of customers. These users are more familiar with **structured EMI-based repayment formats**, as seen in personal loans, home loans, and auto loans. As a result, product comprehension, drawdown confidence, and repayment discipline are negatively impacted when only an OD line is offered.

This gap is particularly visible in:

- Low drawdown rates from sanctioned limits
- Confusion around usage-based interest calculation
- Hesit

**Solution:**
?

Product Overview

We propose a **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the facility construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown.
- **Enabling multiple drawdowns** from the same facility, with flexibility in amount and tenure.
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.
- **Positioning the product clearly as “term loans with flexibility”**

This hybrid approach is designed to increase adoption, improve credit utilization, and grow customer LTV.

**Product Technical Construct**

A **line-backed, multi-drawdown term loan**, where:

- **Both loan and tranche constructs are exposed to the LSP**.
- DSP manages the **loan** as the credit container; **

## #8 — Master collections PRD (NBFC)
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 3, 2024 1:50 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

There are multiple instruments through which NBFC will acquire funds against outstanding of user’s loan account. Following are the one’s we are moving ahead with V1:

- Repayments (PG/Bank account transfer)
- Withdrawals (Collection of charges against withdrawal - Capitalisation)
- Mandate presentation
- Sell-off of collateral to recover funds (Shortfall/Overdue)

**Collections can be of two types:**

- User initiated (Withdrawal / Repayment / Sell-off)
- NBFC initiated (Mandate presentation (Interest and charges) / Sell-off)

This document unites all of the instruments into

**Solution:**
?**

- Withdrawal (Charges collection against withdrawal)
    
    When a user withdraws from their credit line against their pledged assets, we will identify if there are any associated charges due in the loan account. 
    
    If overdue charges are found, charges will be knocked off and the effective amount will be disbursed to the user
    
- Repayment
    
    When a user makes a repayment, their repayment will be accounted against different ledgers of the loan account as per the configured apportionment strategy
    
    Overdue interest -> Overdue charges -> Shortfall principal -> Due interest -> Due charges -> Principal -> Excess
    
- Mandate presentation (Interest collection)

## #12 — Withdrawal Optimisations
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 17, 2024 4:45 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In a 15-day period, 2.84% of the 5130 disbursal requests were rejected, with 1.98% attributed to tech gaps within Volt app. The key problems to address are : 

- Customers see a higher limit on the app and request a bigger amount resulting in failures
- We use a higher limit in our DB which results in withdrawals getting rejected at lender’s end
- Customer raise support tickets and give poor reviews impacting our CSAT and retention
- We face challenges in acquiring new customers due to poor ratings on app
- We are checking the customer’s holding statement which creates issue

## #14 — [TL] Shortfall handling
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** October 1, 2025 1:26 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

---

- We want to implement a robust mechanism to handle shortfall scenarios in term loans. Unlike OD products, term loans involve an outstanding principal amount, which increases the likelihood of shortfalls. This makes it essential to build an efficient and well-defined shortfall handling process specifically for term loans

## #15 — Excess amount handling
**Status:** On Hold | **Last edited:** November 8, 2024 1:55 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

1. Users are not able to withdraw or utilise their complete limit in case their line goes in excess. 
2. Handling of storing of the excess amount data in our DB is not proper. 

---

**Solution:**
?**

- **Current handling :**
    - When user has excess amount in their line -
        - We show the available cash as excess amount itself
        - The DP gets reduced to excess amount amount itself. We also have a limitation of 1000 as minimum amount of withdrawal. In most cases excess is less than 1000 and hence the user is not able to make withdrawal & gets blocked.

![Untitled](Excess%20amount%20handling/Untitled.png)

- **Optimised handling :**
    - **1st approach**
        - We can show an alert to the user that shows the excess amount on the home screen itself.
        - Alert will say: “You have excess amount present in your loan account, click here to withdraw the excess amount”.
        - We will process the excess amounts which are greater than Rs 1 and less than Rs 1000

## #16 — Lien removal SLA tracking report
**Status:** Ready for Tech | **Last edited:** November 7, 2024 8:13 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Users raise lien removal requests via Volt app and web app which are raised directly with the lenders. 

Lien removal requests have broadly three steps:

1. Lien removal request validation
2. Unlodgement of funds
3. Unpledging of funds

The process for the first two steps is done digitally via API however unpledging is done operationally via letters send to the RTAs (CAMS and Kfintech).

Volt and lenders have an operational workflow set between the teams of the two organisations and they need a report to manage SLAs.

**Problem statements:**

1. Volt ops agents should be abl

**Solution:**

Two reports (Revocation request level and ISIN level will be created which will be sent to the lender

**Report 1:**

## #17 — Lodgement maker
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** November 29, 2024 4:43 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Users pledge securities before their loan account is created with the bank, users also pledge additional securities post origination. 

Scenarios can arise where the user has pledged securities, however the same have not been added to their loan account, ops team will need a capability through which they can manually lodge these securities into the user’s loan account via the command centre

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will create a maker task, where the ops agent will be able to select an RTA and basis RTA add a lien reference number (unique to one pledging request). 

Against which we will hit the lien status API and get all the securities pledged in that particular session as well as their current status. Once we have the status, we will give the ops agent to select the desired securities which they want to map to the loan account, and give the user the respective drawing power.

CAMS → Lien reference number

KFIN → KFIN session number

For the sake of convenience, we can call them as a common identifier for easy communication between operations team.

⚠️

Note: This process will have to be done at a RTA level, that is if a user has pledged securities with the two RTAs, we will be crea

## #18 — TATA Dedupe API with updated BRE
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** November 21, 2024 12:42 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- For users whose lender is assigned as TATA, either via BRE logic or hardcoding, an existing loan account with TATA is only detected after the user has completed the application process.
- This leads to a poor user experience, as the user is required to un-pledge their funds and restart the application process from scratch with a different lender.

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will hit the TATA dedupe APIs that will return if a customer holds an active LAS/LAMF relationship with TATA. 

1. The customer is checked for the partner from whom the application is being received
2. We check the DB if there are any specific lender assigned to the partner (eg. Jupiter and some MFDs)
3. If the customer has only TATA assigned as the lender OR any lender, the rest of the process follows.
4. At the step of lender assigning through BRE - dedupe check will be done using PAN number of the user for both TATA and BFL
5. Whenever there is a lender change from BAJAJ to TATA through admin panel  
6. Posidex check to be done if the customer is dedupe negative (customer has no relationship with TATA)
7. Dedupe will be the first check in the BRE and basis the outcome, the rest

## #19 — Foreclosure handling for DSP
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** November 18, 2024 12:09 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Users at this point in time can raise multiple requests at a time, these transactions can often cause the other to fail. 
For example, if a user, raises a withdrawal which is pending with the NBFC to process, and immediately raises a foreclosure, they will be able to, which may cause dangling transactions to be left at our end.

If a user raises a foreclosure request, when a mandate presentation transaction is still processing for them, and we close the loan account, we will have no way to post the proceeds from the presentation into their loan account. 

To solve for such s

**Solution:**
?**

Types of requests (Money/Collateral/Service):

| Type of request | Foreclosure blocked |
| --- | --- |
| Withdrawal | Yes |
| Repayment | Yes |
| Collateral removal | Yes |
| Collateral addition | Yes |
| Excess refund | Yes |
| Mobile update | No |
| Email update | No |
| Foreclosure | Yes |
| Withdrawal reversal | Yes |
| Repayment reversal | Yes |
| Charge reversal | Yes |
| Interest refund | Yes |
| Mandate presentation | Yes |

For any request which is pending, as per the above sheet, foreclosure request will not be processed instead we will pass an error message to the LSP.

Foreclosure cannot be processed as there is an existing pending request (Request ID: [Request ID]). Please resolve or complete the pending request to proceed with foreclosure.

## #21 — KYC Risk Status (NBFC Platform)
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** November 12, 2024 6:05 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

KYC risk status needs to be maintained against each client in the NBFC to maintain appropriate risk classification of customers in the LMS as well as in NBFC.

RBI requires us to maintain risk status for each customer under CDD and EDD measures, for all non face to face account based relationship openings, customer should be classified as high risk. 

For customers classified as high risk, their KYC should be evaluated every 2 years, (Re-KYC) unless a face to face KYC or VCIP is formed for the customer. 

To comply with the same, we need a method to store and display the KYC

**Solution:**
?**

Maintain KYC status and KYC expiry date (2 years post account opening) in LMS as well as internal storage at a client level. 

We will be storing the details at a client level in Finflux (datatables - clientkycdetails) and internally in Finflux against client ID.

The same will be visible for the operations and risk teams on the command centre on the client details and KYC details page

## #22 — Repayment flow for DSP
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** November 11, 2024 8:01 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

We offer three payment methods for a user to be able to make a repayment towards their loan via Razorpay:

- UPI
- Debits cards (Rupay)
- Net banking

For net banking, Razorpay assists us with partnering with different banks so that they can offer net banking as a service with our sponsor bank (Yes bank). Currently we are only utilising Razorpay integration as an LSP (via Volt) and do not have a repayment flow on the DSP website. 

To enable large banks like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, IDFC bank, we need to have a repayment flow on the DSP website to meet compliance requirements.

We will build an intermediate repayment flow for users to be able to make a repayment on their loan account on the DSP landing page (to showcase to Banking partners)

## #23 — Phase 1 LTV Tenure Update_LOS
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** May 29, 2026 8:52 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

DSP's LAMF product offers 45% LTV on equity and hybrid funds, compared to 70% LTV offered by banks — making it structurally uncompetitive. This gap limits DSP on three fronts:

- **Existing customers** are under-drawing against already-pledged assets, leaving loan book growth on the table
- **New customers** in lower-ticket segments have sufficient collateral at 70% LTV but fall below viable thresholds at 45%
- **Product parity** with banks cannot be achieved without closing this 25pp LTV gap

**Solution:**
?**

**In scope:**
Product

- Support for both LTV45 & 70 product offers
- Support for  6-year tenure migration
- Partner-specific product config (LTV 45/70) for recommended offer
- Providing offer visibility to Sales/CS

## #24 — [Platform] Callbacks for LSP APIs for core servici
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** May 29, 2026 6:19 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

There are core transaction and request lifecycles that need to be managed by the LSP. 

Volt as an LSP has built a lot of pollers and CRON jobs at specific days over existing lender APIs to solve for this. However this approach has a lot of challenges.

- Introduces a lot of computational load both at the LSP as well as the lender
- Not very accurate, as logic is based on top of hitting jobs on specific dates and times
- Requires a lot of maintenance at an engineering level across systems

Most of these APIs get data from core systems like the CTMS or the LMS, and this often

**Solution:**
?**

Building callbacks for core servicing flows:

- Due collection (lifecycle)
    - When interest becomes due
    - When mandate is presented
    - When mandate collection is successful
    - When mandate collection fails
    - When interest is settled
- Repayment
    - When a repayment is posted into the user’s loan account
- Shortfall
    - When shortfall is identified (daily job) in a user’s loan account
    - When shortfall updates for a loan account (change in amount/ageing)
    - When shortfall is settled for a user’s loan account
    - When shortfall crosses grace period (due date) and sell-off is initiated for the user
    - When sell off is completed
- Foreclosure
    - When a foreclosure request is approved for the user

## #25 — PRD — Term Loan Repayment STP Threshold Update
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** May 29, 2026 5:51 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Current STP repayment thresholds are overly conservative, causing valid low-risk repayments to be unnecessarily routed to NSTP via `REPAYMENT_AMOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (>₹15L) and `REPAYMENT_DAILY_COUNT_EXCEEDED` (>4 repayments/day per LAN).
- Jan–May 2026 production data shows minimal breach risk: only 3 of 1,952 customers (0.15%) made repayments above ₹15L (max observed: ₹20.1L), and no LAN exceeded 5 repayments in a day — indicating the limits can be safely relaxed.
- Unlike other LSPs (Razorpay for Volt, PhonePe dashboard for PhonePe), there is no Cred repayment dashboard a

## #26 — Sell-off Repayment Reconciliation — Maker Automati
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** May 29, 2026 3:39 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Today, the maker step for sell-off repayment reconciliation is entirely manual: the ops team downloads the bank statement and RTA/MFC payout reports, manually cross-references UTRs and amounts, and then maps each payout row transaction to a CDID before uploading the `bulk_unlodgement_post_sell_off` file into the Command Centre.
- This process is error-prone, time-consuming, and creates a daily dependency on ops/analytics bandwidth before the repayment posting flow can even begin.

**Solution:**
?

**In scope:**
- Daily automated UTR matching between payout reports (KFin, CAMS, MFC) and bank statement.
- Amount validation (BS settled amount vs. report expected deposit amount) at row level.
- Intra-report UTR deduplification before matching.
- PAN → FXLAN → SCRID → CDID key-based resolution per pledge source and repo type.
- CDID uniqueness enforcement with disambiguation logic for repeated sales.
- Row-le

Volt Money's Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF OD) product has strong unit economics and high borrower quality.

Currently, Volt has no mechanism to leverage its existing user base (borrowers who have experienced the value of Volt Money's LAMF product or users who know about the platform), for new user acquisition through word-of-mouth in an organized and trackable manner.

We need a **trust-first, low-CAC acquisition method** built on the credibility of existing borrowers by activating them to refer new users to Volt LAMF OD product. This would also build trust amongst new us

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Today, all sell-off repayment reconciliation(approval) requests initiated via "Bulk Unlodgement Post Sell Off" in the Ops Command Centre go through the NSTP path — every record creates a checker task requiring manual review and approval.
- With an average of 173 requests per day (as of Jan–March 2026), manual processing introduces delay in repayment reconciliation execution.
- Manual processing increases operational bandwidth consumption of OPS team and introduces human-prone errors.

# Higher LTV Product – Customer Communication Framework # Background As part of the Higher LTV Product initiative, the NBFC will enable eligible customers to increase their sanctioned credit limit basis revised LTV eligibility on pledged mutual fund holdings. Since the LTV enhancement flow involves execution of revised loan documentation and customer consent, it introduces the following communication requirements: 1. Customers must receive the revised KFS and Agreement/Amendment documents executed as part of the LTV update flow. 2. Customers must be notified once their revised credit limit is successfully updated. 3. From the LSP perspective, the feature needs to be promoted proactively while also ensuring customers receive timely status notifications throughout the journey. --- # Proposed Solution ## 1. NBFC (DSP) Communications From the NBFC side, a post-facto communication shall be sent once the customer’s limit enhancement request is successfully processed through the LTV update flow. The communication will serve the following purposes: - Inform customers regarding successful limit enhancement - Share revised loan documentation for customer reference - Ensure regulatory and audit compliance for executed agreements ### Communication Channels - Email - SMS --- ### DSP Email Communication | Field | Details | | --- | --- | | Communication Trigger | Successful completion of LTV update flow | | Purpose | Notify customer regarding revised credit limit and share updated KFS/Agreement | | Template ID | d-dbcef3df48ca4908a47b8e1c98e5c5c9 | | Variables | clientId, date, lan, updated_credit_limit, additional_credit_limit, previous_credit_limit | | Attachments | Loan kit (KFS + Amendment) | --- ### DSP SMS Communication | Field | Details | | --- | --- | | Communication Trigger | Successful completion of LTV update flow | | Purpose | Notify customer regarding successful credit limit enhancement | | Template ID | 1107177910598106787 | | Tempalte Name | LTV_Update_Limit_enhancement_V2 | | Copy | Congratulations {{customerName}}, your credit limit for the loan account {{lan}} has been successfully increased to Rs {{updated_credit_limit}}.

## #30 — Dropping PAN Verification flow
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** May 21, 2026 7:53 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In the LAMF digital loan journey, customers are required to set up an eNACH mandate as part of the Loan Origination System (LOS) process. The **mandate value is fixed at ₹10 lakhs**, irrespective of the customer’s actual credit limit, which may range from **₹10,000 to ₹2 crore**.

This “one-size-fits-all” approach creates friction for customers with lower credit limits. For example, a customer with a sanctioned limit of ₹50,000 may be reluctant to authorize a ₹10 lakh mandate, leading to abandonment of the journey at this step and/or increase in the number of support queries

## #33 — Term Loan LOS requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** May 14, 2026 10:50 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- **Low awareness of line-based lending products:** Most Indian consumers do not understand the concept of a reusable credit line or overdraft (OD)-style borrowing.
- **Poor use of the product as a one-time loan:** Even when users opt in, they typically draw down only once and never return, leading to poor utilization of the approved credit limit.
- **Lack of lifecycle borrowing behavior:** Users do not engage in multiple drawdowns or reborrowing after repayment, resulting in limited customer lifetime value (LTV).
- **Ineffective product positioning:** The existing product f

**Solution:**
?**

Product Overview

We propose a **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the line construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown.
- **Enabling multiple drawdowns** from the same line, with flexibility in amount and tenure.
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.
- **Positioning the product clearly as “term loans with flexibility”**

This hybrid approach is designed to increase adoption, improve credit line utilization, and grow customer LTV.

**Product Technical Construct**

A **line-backed, multi-drawdown term loan**, where:

- **Both loan and tranche constructs are exposed to the LSP**.
- DSP manages the **loan** as the credit container; **e

# Term loan CC enhancements # **Background and Context** - Operations teams currently face multiple visibility and workflow challenges while managing term loans in Command Centre. - Closed tranches automatically disappear from Command Centre once they are closed, resulting in complete loss of visibility for the Ops team for historical tracking and issue resolution. - Excess refund handling for term loans differs from OD loans. Tranche-tagged excess margins are non-refundable, however Command Centre currently does not provide a granular split between refundable and non-refundable excess. This creates inconsistencies between excess refund tasks and the loan details page, making it difficult for Ops teams to follow existing SOPs. - During collateral release approval flows, Ops teams need to validate whether requested DP for un-pledge is within permissible limits `(Unpledge requested DP <= Total DP - TOS)`. Currently, checker tasks do not display TOS or due details, forcing Ops users to manually navigate to loan details pages to retrieve data, leading to delays and increased chances of operational errors. - These gaps impact operational efficiency, increase dependency on manual checks, and create risks of incorrect approvals/refunds. --- # **1.

There can arise scenarios where the user pledges securities with the NBFC and changes their mind and does not end up taking a loan with the NBFC. 

As per an RBI regulation, the REs are supposed to release all the original movable / immovable property documents and remove charges registered with any registry within a period of 30 days after full repayment/ settlement of the loan account. ([Link](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_CircularIndexDisplay.aspx?Id=12535&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

NBFC currently supports unpledging requests only at a loan account level, a loan account is created only when the origination process (loan application) is completed by the user. We will be creating an opportunity level unpledging workflow (using step functions) to support the complete unpledging process.

We will be rounding up or down the foreclosure amount based on the half even rounding strategy where:

- If due amount at the time of foreclosure is more than or equal to N.5 it will be rounded up to N+1
- If due amount is less than N.5 it will be rounded down to N

The same will be passed on to the LSP as foreclosure amount. When the user makes the corresponding payment, we will collect it and accept the foreclosure request.

There can be two corresponding cases post the transaction is posted into the loan account:

- Account is in excess of an amount less than 1 Rs
- Account has an outstanding of an amount less than 1 Rs

**Scenario 1:**

- DSP Finance is required by RBI regulations to report borrowers with outstanding interest dues to credit bureaus.

---

- Currently partner LSPs are looking for an alternate payments methods than the payment like because -
    - They have an existing UI flow ready to support VA accounts (SmallCase)
    - They want to provide a back-up repayment option in case payment link is down

**Solution:**

- DSP will expose APIs that enable each partner LSP to retrieve a virtual account (VA) number uniquely mapped to a customer’s loan account. Instead of embedding the VA generation logic within each LSP’s system, this design centralizes the logic at DSP’s end. As a result, if DSP ever modifies the way VAs are generated—due to regulatory, operational, or technical changes—no updates are required on the LSP side.
- This decouples the VA logic from partner implementations and ensures long-term scalability, consistency, and ease of maintenance across all integrations.
- LSPs will get the status of VA repayment through the repayment order status update web hook

- NBFCs using NACH mandates face delays in mandate registration and activation due to dependency on bank processing times (T+2 to T+7 days).
- Physical NACH mandates have high failure rates due to signature mismatches, and bank rejections, leading to delayed interest collection.
- Borrowers often drop off during NACH mandate registration because it requires physical forms, wet signatures, or authentication(Aadhaar, Netbanking, or debit card), leading to lower activation rates.

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Requests raised by the users in relation to their loan account and application journey go through STP and non STP flow. Non STP transactions go through an approval mechanism on the command centre.

As we continue to launch the DSP platform across channels, we will require platform and request level checks and rule engines to control approval mechanisms and handle teething phases for launch across channels.

Partner and channel level BRE configurations:
We will be building partner and channel level BRE capabilities to define STP and non STP rule engine which will govern the approval of a task.

<aside>
💡

For example: We may approve STP lodgements for Volt while keeping it an approval flow for a new partner like Groww or IndMoney

</aside>

Request level BRE configurations:

We will be building request level rules which will govern if the said request will be going through an STP flow or a non STP flow (checker approval).

Each rule can have a threshold value which can be different at a request/channel level.

For example: We have a rule to auto approve lodgement requests with a limit under 10 lakh for Volt and 2 lakhs for Groww

# Product note: LMS integration with Tally ## **Background and Context** - - Who is facing the problem (users, internal teams, partners) - What is the challenge that they are facing? What is broken today? - Why is it important? or What is getting impacted? Most businesses record transactions across multiple ledgers to accurately classify income, expenses, assets, and liabilities arising from each business event such as product sales, and discounts. For us as an NBFC, core business transactions include interest posting, charge application, payouts against sanctioned limits, and customer repayments. Given the regulated nature of lending, NBFC accounting processes are subject to direct regulatory scrutiny by the RBI. It is therefore critical that accounting is accurate, automated, system-driven, and free from manual intervention. Currently, accounting entries are generated in the LMS and then manually transformed and posted into the ERP. This manual handoff introduces operational and control risks. This gap was highlighted as a key vulnerability in our statutory audit and must be addressed as a priority. --- ## **1. Problem scope** ### In scope - - What specific problems are we solving? - Who are we solving it for? Consider both primary and secondary users - **Manual ERP Posting Dependency**: Accounting entries are generated in Finflux (LMS) but are **manually transformed and uploaded into Tally**, creating operational dependency on the Finance team. - **High Risk of Errors and Duplicates**: Manual handling increases the risk of: - Duplicate ledger postings - Incorrect ledger mapping - Debit / credit sign errors - Partial or missed uploads **Lack of Idempotency & Control**: There is currently: - No system enforced idempotency for ERP postings - No way to prevent re-posting of the same transaction - Limited ability to trace an LMS transaction to a Tally voucher **Delayed and Unpredictable TAT**: Posting timelines depend on: - Manual availability of the Finance team - Ad-hoc batch preparation and uploads This leads to **inconsistent turnaround times** **Access control**: Current workflows do not consistently enforce: - System-driven approvals - Clear separation between generation, validation, and posting of accounting entries. ### Out of scope - - Call out on items out of scope - Rationale for exclusion - Manual Reconciliation: Reconciliation between LMS (Finflux) and ERP (Tally) is currently manual and time-intensive, requiring cross-system data pulls and comparisons. This will be picked as an enhancement once the current release is stabilised. ETA to be confirmed - Delayed

**Problem:**

1. **Lack of Loan Account Status Updates:** B2B partners like Zype are not notified if a loan account has been successfully created for a user. This leads to delays in servicing their customers effectively.
2. **Absence of Critical Callbacks:** Partners do not receive essential webhooks such as margin shortfall notifications and their aging details, leading to confusion and data disparities across systems.

## #57 — Axis bank e-collect API integration for virtual ac

Currently, we are accepting repayments from customers through payment gateway for adhoc repayments and NACH for interest repayments. While this will cater to customers who are on app/website, there are multiple scenarios where a customer might want to repayment directly to DSP’s account.

Problems are divided between two key stakeholders:

- NBFC (operations/business/product)
- Customers

Steps for accepting a VA payment:

- NBFC gets a e-collect code
- NBFC appends a unique reference number (for each loan) and shares the virtual account with the customer (total length has to be less than or equal to 28 characters where first 6 characters would be the e-collect code).

## #58 — [Platform] Mandate collection BRE optimisation
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** January 30, 2025 5:01 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

There are multiple ways through which an NBFC can collect dues from customers:

- Accepting direct user initiated payments (VA/PG)
- Collecting payments via debiting user’s bank accounts (mandate)
- Invoking securities to clear dues (Sell off)

All repayment methods have different use cases and scenarios in which they are triggered. Mandate collection repayments are done for the following use case:

- User convenience and financial health: Amount is automatically deducted from the user’s bank account and ensures that their loan account does not become overdue
- NBFC portfoli

**Solution:**
?**

- We will be integrating with the Finflux (LMS) overdue API which gives us due level information:
    - Due type (Interest / Charge / Penal charge / Interest overdue)
    - Due amount
    - Due from
    - Due date
- Based on this information we will run a BRE to select which dues are eligible for collection via mandate from the user:
    - Any due where due date is below the last day of the billing cycle is of the type (interest + charges + penal charges) is eligible for collection.
- We will rename the bounce charges to make them dishounour charges to make it explicit for the user that since their account is in an overdue state, they are being charged an overdue fee.

Charge short name: DC (Deployed in UAT)
- Users will only be charged an dishounour charges if there was an interest o

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

For a loan account there are certain particulars that are maintained to understand what is the total due that the user has against their loan account. They are described as follows:

- Principal outstanding: This is sum of the amount that the user has withdrawn minus the repaid (as partial principal repayments) to the NBFC
- Interest due - This is the amount that is due for the user from the previous billing cycle, calculated as accruals based on their principal outstanding at a daily level (currently we follow a daily accrual model)
- Charges due - This is the sum of all ou

## #61 — [Fenix] Lodgement maker bulk approval
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** January 16, 2026 7:47 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

We operate with two RTAs, CAMS and KFIN, while CAMS currently offers synchronous lien marking of funds (will soon move to asynchronous pledging), KFIN’s lien marking process is asynchronous.

That is upon submitting a lien marking request, we get a request successfully accepted status, post which we poll for a confirmation of lien marking with KFIN using lien status API to get a confirmation. 

Following requirements and discussions will be specific (as per current implementation) to KFIN pledging but would be designed in a way to support both CAMS and KFIN asynchronous pled

**Solution:**
?**

We will be building a bulk lodgement maker which will enable DSP operations team to manually lodge securities into a loan account of users which were previously rejected / or were failed to be raised for lodgement by the NBFC.

(Customers can directly reach DSP Finance support team for lodgements if their requests are not supported by the LSP)

While we give this functionality to the operations team, it is of utmost important to build validations both via operations (maker/checker) and system (validations) to ensure there are no invalid lodgements into the loan account of the user.

If a lodgement is incorrectly lodged into the loan account of the user, it will expose the NBFC to open financial risk, where the user can withdraw more than they could have causing LTV breaches and even s

## #62 — [Final] End use capture of transactions
**Status:** Pending Review | **Last edited:** January 15, 2026 5:13 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- As per RBI guidelines, lenders are required to record the end use of loan disbursements to prevent misuse or diversion of funds and to enable traceability of customer transactions if necessary. Currently, our system does not ask users to specify the purpose of withdrawals, which is a compliance gap.
- Additionally, capturing end use helps improve internal reporting and risk management.

---

**Solution:**
?**

- **Capture end use during each withdrawal**
    - **Pros**: Enables granular tracking of the specific purpose behind each withdrawal, offering clear visibility into usage patterns.
    - **Cons**:
        - Complicates the mapping between repayments and disbursements, especially when multiple withdrawals have different declared purposes.
        - Involves higher development effort, as UI changes (e.g., dropdowns on withdrawal screens) would be required.
- **Incorporate tweaks in the end use declaration within the loan agreement [Prioritised]**
    - **Pros**: Minimal engineering effort, as no changes to withdrawal screens are needed.
    - **Cons**: Limits visibility into actual usage at a transaction level, which may reduce data fidelity for downstream analysis or compliance.

Volt Money's Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF OD) product has strong unit economics and high borrower quality.

Currently, Volt has no mechanism to leverage its existing user base (borrowers who have experienced the value of Volt Money's LAMF product or users who know about the platform), for new user acquisition through word-of-mouth in an organized and trackable manner.

The operations team needs to verify loan collateral before lodgement for the following conditions:

1. Loan Value over 10L: To ensure we are not in credit risk in cases with large amounts
2. Date mismatch (more than a day): To ensure the funds which are up for lodgements are still pledged and no un-pledging request for those funds have been raised.

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

When a user makes repayment to their loan account for either part payment or foreclosing their account, or initiates a sell off there can arise scenarios where the user’s account goes into excess.
This excess if the account is not under foreclosure, is automatically refunded via a daily CRON job that identifies loan accounts in excess, and initiates a payout of an amount equal to excess to regularise the account.

However there can arise scenarios, where this amount is less than Rs 1, if such an amount is found in excess, the corresponding payout for the account fails, as Ca

We will be making enhancements in our excess job and foreclosure job to solve this problem:

- Excess job will only have accounts where excess amount will be greater than 1
- If an account has an active foreclosure request, or a pending disbursement, it will not be eligible for an excess refund and will be ignored in the excess refund job
- We will be creating transaction type “excess_adjustment” for excess refund transactions, the same will be passed as a type when doing a excess transaction
- We will be setting up transaction type accounting events for excess refund for two scenarios:
    - Excess refund below 1 Rs (liability transfer)

A sell off is the process of invocation of a lien on a user’s security. That is when the lender or the pledgee, invokes their right to redeem the units of a security pledged by the user with the lender.

There are two types of sell off:

- Lender initiated sell off
    - Lender initiates sell off of securities to recover outstanding amount (30 DPD)
    - Lender initiates sell of to regularise the user’s loan account (shortfall)
- User requested sell off
    - User requests a sell off due to inability to fulfil their commitments towards the credit line

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

**DSP offers a credit line facility to users for a tenure of 3 years.** Maintaining this credit line involves ongoing costs including customer servicing, technology infrastructure, portfolio monitoring, and operational overheads.

To ensure the long-term sustainability of the offering and continue delivering high-quality service, **we propose introducing an Annual Maintenance Charge (AMC)**. This will serve as a recurring revenue stream to offset the costs associated with account maintenance and user support throughout the lifecycle of the credit line.

## #76 — DSP - Charges Deduction Identification Wrapper API
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

Lending Service Providers (LSPs) receive charges data(in loan summary API) but cannot easily identify which charges will be deducted from the loan disbursal amount (net disbursal) and which will not. The existing API lacks explicit categorisation or clear indication, leading to confusion and incorrect communication to customers about the deduction of charges.

**Solution:**
?

Create a **wrapper API** that:

- Use FinFlux Charges API “Get Account Charge Api”.
    - UAT URL: [https://uat-voltmoney.finfluxtrial.io/fineract-provider/api/v1/revolving-credit-lines/000000049/charges](https://uat-voltmoney.finfluxtrial.io/fineract-provider/api/v1/revolving-credit-lines/000000049/charges)
- Uses a **configurable mapping** of `chargeIdentifier` and/or `chargeId` to determine if a charge is deducted from disbursal.
- Returns two clean, separate lists:
    - **deductedFromDisbursal**
    - **notDeductedFromDisbursal**
- Provides a clear, consistent API response optimized for LSP consumption.
- Supports easy updates to the mapping without any changes at FinFlux end.

## #78 — Foreclosure repayment - Handle PenalInterestAccrue
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- In foreclosure request we have not handled the “PenalInterestAccruedNotDue” field in the calculation of net payable amount which is leading to the rejection of foreclosure request.

---

**Solution:**
?**

- Include the "PenalInterestAccruedNotDue" field in the calculation of the net payable.
- Display the "PenalInterestAccruedNotDue" amount on the UI.
    - The backend (BE) needs to send this field with its value to the frontend (FE), so the FE can display it on the UI and use it to calculate the amount shown to the user.
    - Outstanding interest amount should include the value of “PenalInterestAccruedNotDue”

## #79 — Handle excess amount in foreclosure request [TCL]
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- There are no handling of excess amount for TATA customer in foreclosure flow

---

**Solution:**
?**

- When user loan account are in excess and user want to foreclose the loan then we should initiate the withdrawal for the amount equal to excess amount and once withdrawal is success then initiate the foreclosure request.
- How to identify if user account are in excess:
    - In the foreclosure details, If netPayable are in Negative then we can say that user loan account has a excess amount.
    - If NetPayable are Positive then user has to repay the amount and if NetPayable amount is in Negative then we need to raise the withdrawal amount equal to the NetPayable amount.
- Prerequisite: Need to handle “PenalInterestAccruedNotDue”

## #80 — LAS LMS approach notes
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

# LAS LMS approach notes # Summary: We are planning to launch LAS (Loan Against Securities) for the B2B2C channel, targeting the first 1,000 customers(10 application per day) to measure adoption and define success metrics. For Phase 1, the objective is to enable this launch with minimal changes to the existing product experience. Key considerations: No changes for users who have only a LAMF (Loan Against Mutual Funds) account. No changes in the loan servicing experience for users with only an LAS account. For users holding both LAS and LAMF accounts, we will adopt an “elevate approach” (In elegant way) to effectively manage multiple loan accounts within the same interface. ## LMS service scenarios ### Customer with only LAMF account 1. No change in existing behaviour, flow and configurations ### Customer with only LAS account Expected changes in existing modules | **Modules** | Requirements | Edge cases scenarios | Action items | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Lodgement + Account opening | 1. For LAS, this is expected that pledge confirmation may take 3-4 days. and hence we shouldn’t allow to place disbursal request immediately after loan application is completed 2.

## #83 — Volt Apps & Web Multiple Loan Handling - Launching
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

DSP Finance is launching **LAS (Loan Against Shares) for B2B2C customers**. 

To enable customers to seamlessly manage their LAS loan accounts, we need to build a **scalable, modular, and user-friendly loan servicing experience** within the Volt platform.

The servicing module must support:

1. **LAS loan management** — for customers availing loan against shares
2. **LAMF loan management** — for existing customers availing loan against mutual funds
3. **Unified product** — for users holding **both LAS and LAMF**, offering an intuitive, consistent experience across products 


**Solution:**
?**

Volt will provide a **modular loan account management system** that supports:

1. **LAS-only servicing**
2. **LAMF-only servicing**
3. **Hybrid servicing (both LAS + LAMF[Multi-lender])**
    1. Support of multiple loan type(OD, TL) under the umbrella of different product type (LAMF, LAS)
4. **Cohesive communication and notification design for both products**
    1. **Messages are clearly distinguished yet work seamlessly together, preventing confusion for users managing multiple loan products⁠**

## #84 — Volt Mandate re-registration Post loan
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In the current LOS journey, users are required to add their bank account and complete mandate registration as part of the loan application process. However, after the loan account is created, users may face situations where they need to re-register the mandate or update their bank account. These situations typically arise due to:

1. Initial mandate registration failure
2. Revocation of mandate by the user
3. User’s intention to change the previously added bank account (e.g., convenience, account freeze, operational issues) — applicable across all lending partners

At presen

**Solution:**
?**

- **Mandate and bank account details visibility:** On the account details page, show bank account information and mandate registration status (registered / not registered / pending).
- **Conditional Actions & Validations based on mandate status:**
    - If mandate is **registered**:
        - User can attempt to **add a new bank account (max 5 bank account is allowed to add from UI)** and **set up mandate** on the new account.
            - For both the lenders(DSP & TCL), Bank account for the disbursal and mandate should be always same.
            - Every time user try to setup mandate (switch mandate) on the bank account either new or old, bank verification using penny drop needs to be done for both DSP and TCL.
        - **Validation:** If the user **fails to add or verify the new

## #86 — [Platform] Mandate presentation request optimisati
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** December 31, 2024 11:49 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

We are solving three problems via this enhancement:

- Mandate presentation UTR entries for the destination bank (User) are very general. Since the amount is deducted automatically from the user’s bank account, it often gets difficult to track why the amount was deducted (across services and products) while analysing bank account statements.
- Currently reconciliation for mandate presentations is built on top of item ids (shared by Digio) to us in response and also passed as a parameter in the report.

---

**Solution:**
?**

P1:

- We will be passing custom narrations in the user’s bank account statement
DSP Finance NACH debit for LAN: FXLAN534324

and UTR in the user’s loan account statement:
Loan repayment received against sale of security: IN9876543210 for account number: FXLAN6789012 with Ref ID:

## #87 — Skip Email verification
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** December 29, 2025 11:59 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Email verification is currently mandatory for loan application creation. However, we’re seeing around 15% **user drop-off** at this step. To reduce friction, we propose letting users **choose their preferred primary communication channel — SMS or Email** — and **skip email verification** for those who select SMS. This allows users who rely on SMS to continue without being blocked by email OTP verification.

Volt Money's Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF OD) product has strong unit economics and high borrower quality.

Currently, Volt does not have any mechanism to leverage its existing loan users base who has experienced the value of Volt Money LAMF product for new user acquisitions.

## #89 — Single drawdown Term Loan LMS Requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** August 9, 2025 11:23 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- **Low awareness of line-based lending products:** Most Indian consumers do not understand the concept of a reusable credit line or overdraft (OD)-style borrowing.
- **Lack of lifecycle borrowing behaviour:** Users do not engage in re-borrowing after repayment, resulting in limited customer lifetime value (LTV).

---

**Solution:**
?**

Product Overview

We propose a vanilla **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the line construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.

This hybrid approach is designed to increase adoption and grow customer LTV.

**Product Technical Construct**

A **line-backed, single-drawdown term loan**, where:

- DSP creates and manages the line & loan internally for eligibility and lifecycle logic.
- **Only the loan construct is exposed to the LSP**, appearing as a standard term loan.
- Only one single **active** loan drawdown is supported at a time in this construct ie loan = line at any pt in time
- Future draw

## #90 — [Platform] RTA portfolio API integration
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** August 25, 2025 8:02 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As an NBFC that offers loans against mutual fund, we have the capability to let the user fetch their securities, select eligible funds and then allowing them to pledge the corresponding securities in the name of the NBFC. 

This allows the NBFC to give the corresponding limit to the user in return, which they can then use for a myriad of use cases.

Since mutual funds (now) are a digital security, and only the pledge (contract between NBFC and the investor) there are potential collateral/potential risks that can arise between the user pledging/invoking/revoking the securitie

**Solution:**
?**

We will be integrating with portfolio APIs of the RTAs for three core collateral transactions in our system to validate the requests synchronously.

- Lodgement
- Revocation
- Invocation

The APIs give response at a combination of an ISIN + Folio + Lien marking number

KFIN Request body:

## #95 — NBFC NACH Mandate Limit Change
**Status:** Ready for Tech | **Last edited:** August 13, 2025 6:31 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In the LAMF digital loan journey, customers are required to set up an eNACH mandate as part of the Loan Origination System (LOS) process. The **mandate value is fixed at ₹10 lakhs**, irrespective of the customer’s actual credit line, which may range from **₹10,000 to ₹2 crore**.

This “one-size-fits-all” approach creates friction for customers with lower credit limits. For example, a customer with a sanctioned limit of ₹50,000 may be reluctant to authorize a ₹10 lakh mandate, leading to abandonment of the journey at this step and/or increase in the number of support queries.

## #98 — [Platform] Validation to Stop Un-pledging, closure
**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** April 4, 2025 2:21 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Account freezing or suspension is a temporary restriction that prevents an account holder from accessing specific or all account features. This occurs for several reasons:

- Suspicious activity detection
- Policy violations
- Payment issues
- Security concerns

We have the operations team, and risk team who can place an account under suspension or frozen state. 

The frozen state **ALSO** occurs when an active account undergoes foreclosure procedure so as to prevent the user from initiating any debit transactions while the account closure is in process.

Freezing an account

**Solution:**
?**

We will be adding some validations to stop foreclosure and un-pledging of the manually frozen accounts.

The foreclosure check will include:

1. If the account is active/expired, freeze it and continue the foreclosure process
2. In case if an account is frozen before the initiation of the foreclosure by the user, it has to be rejected.

The un-pledging check will include:

1. If the account had been frozen, don’t go forward with the un-pledging
2. If is active, then continue with the pledging

- Currently, our system does not have a standardized mechanism to validate mobile numbers against authoritative revocation and risk datasets.
- This creates a gap where deactivated or reassigned numbers can still be used within onboarding and auth flows, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information (like OTPs) to unintended users.
- Additionally, numbers flagged by Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) for fraud or non-compliance may remain undetected, increasing the platform’s exposure to fraud risk and regulatory non-comp

**Solution:**
?**

- We propose implementing MNRL validation at two critical touchpoints in the user journey to ensure early risk detection and strict compliance at the point of loan creation.
- Currently, mobile numbers appear in the MNRL dataset for multiple reasons. As part of the implementation, users will be blocked from loan account creation only for specific high-risk categories, based on compliance requirements.

# Product Note – DRPS (Final Version – Unified Format) # 1. Background & Context ## Who is facing the problem - End customers using LAMF (Credit Line / LAS) - Customer support & operations teams - NBFC (regulatory requirement to provide updated repayment schedule) --- ## What is the challenge today - Static schedules become outdated after: - Disbursement - Part repayment - ROI change - Charge application - Users depend on SOA to understand updated dues. - No single structured month-wise forward view aligned with current POS. --- ## Why this is important LAMF is a **dynamic demand loan**, not a fixed EMI loan. A Dynamic Repayment Schedule must: - Reflect actual utilisation - Reflect historical interest accrual - Provide predictive view till closure - Be aligned with system ledger - Be audit-reconcilable --- # 2.

## #102 — VA Repayment Handling [Volt LMS]
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** April 10, 2025 10:50 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, Volt cannot create the Virtual Account (VA) repayment requests, resulting in an inability to track and post repayments made through Virtual Accounts. This creates a gap between DSP Finance's successful repayment processing and Volt's internal payment posting system, leading to potential reconciliation issues and incomplete financial records.

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will implement a webhook integration system that receives repayment notifications from DSP Finance when a customer successfully makes a repayment via their Virtual Account. The system will map the FXLAN (Fenix Loan Account Number) provided in the webhook to our internal creditId, allowing us to properly post and track these repayments in our database.

## #115 — E2E Sell-off Productisation V1
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Today, sell-off execution is a fully manual, analytics-dependent process — ops teams rely on daily risk reports, manually compute DPD and shortfall sell off amounts, select funds, prepare maker file, and initiate sell-offs via the Command Centre.
- With an average of 193 sell-off requests per day (Jan–March 2026) and a peak of upto 4000 DPD requests in a single day(on 21st Apr 2026), this introduces significant delay between trigger and execution.
- Any error in selecting accounts for sell off , sell off amount computation, fund selection, or file preparation by analytics an

**Solution:**
?

**In scope:**
- Daily automated identification of shortfall-eligible LANs (`shortfall_ageing >= 7`) and DPD-eligible LANs (DPD > 75 trigger 1st and then 21st-of-month trigger)
- Shortfall amount and DPD amount computation per LAN using get overdue detail API and shortfall ageing data
- Ongoing sell-off detection from `fenix_sell_off_collaterals_request` and appropriate skip/adjustment logic
- 5% execution buffe

## #116 — API flow for KFS and Agreement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As a platform, there are multiple ways through which LSPs can integrate with our platform, our current implementation offers a redirection flow for collecting KFS consent and Agreement signatures.

In the redirection flow, the customer’s IP and acknowledgement/ signing timestamps are consumed. However not all LSPs would be comfortable with redirecting the users to a different URL for the following reasons:

- They want to own the customer experience (having a different UI will impact their user journey).
- Redirection URLs often require internal approvals to whitelist domain

**Solution:**
?**

We will be decoupling the existing sequential process of Key Fact Statement (KFS) and Agreement generation by building independent APIs. This will enable Loan Service Providers (LSPs) to:

- Generate KFS and Agreement documents separately.
- Collect KFS acknowledgements and Agreement signatures independently via APIs.

This modular approach enhances flexibility and improves integration capabilities for partner platforms.

Additional changes:

- **Validation Layer:** Implement robust validation mechanisms to ensure that all collected data and process flows remain compliant with regulatory guidelines and internal business rules.
- **Command centre changes:** Implement changes to enable operations team to identify, and accordingly handle different sign methodologies separately

## #117 — Additional details enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

To support underwriting and assess the end use of funds, we currently collect the following additional user details:

- Marital status
- Educational qualification
- Mother's first and last name
- Father's first and last name
- Loan purpose
- Income range
- Employment status

While this information is essential, requiring users to fill seven separate fields has contributed to a noticeable drop-off rate—ranging from **1% to 5% across different LSPs**—which negatively impacts the top of the funnel.

---

**Solution:**
?**

- V2 API with optional and mandatory fields
    - Mandatory fields:
        - Employment details
        - Income range
        - Father’s name
        - Loan purpose
    - Optional fields
        - Educational qualification
        - Mother’s name

# Analytics requirement for amortisation of PF Last Edited: April 24, 2026 8:59 AM PRD ETA: April 24, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **1. Objective** Generate month-level amortised accounting entries for Processing Fee (PF) income against loan accounts across LAMF, LAS, and Term Loan product lines. The report will be consumed by the Finance team and downloaded on-demand from the Finflux analytics module. The design must be extensible to accommodate other fee/cost types in future iterations without structural rework. # **2. Scope & Exclusions** ## **2.1 In Scope** - Product lines: LAMF, LAS, Term Loan (TL) - Charge type: Processing Fee (PF) - Accounting entries: Income recognition at monthly amortisation level - Amortisation method: Straight Line Method (SLM) - Report period: M-N (N>0) (previous calendar months only) - Waiver handling: Partial and complete waivers with corresponding reverse entries - Loan closure handling: Remaining balance acceleration on closure date ## **2.2 Explicitly Out of Scope** - GST component of processing fee excluded from amortisation entries - Current month entries - report is strictly retrospective - Real-time or intra-month amortisation schedules # **3. Source Data & Key Fields** All data will be sourced from the accounting report. The following fields are required at a schedule/charge level: | **Field** | **Source / Table** | **Notes** | | --- | --- | --- | | FXLAN / Term Loan Account No. | LMS – Loan Master | External loan identifier | | Client External ID | LMS – Loan Master | FXCID reference | | Product Type | LMS – Loan Master | LAMF / LAS / TL | | Charge Application Date | LMS – Fee Schedule | Date PF was applied | | PF Income Amount | LMS – Fee Schedule | Excludes GST; 'Income from Fees' leg only | | Transaction ID (Fees) | LMS – Transaction Log | Original fee transaction reference | | Loan Status | LMS – Loan Master | Active / Closed | | Closure Date | LMS – Loan Master | Populated only if loan is closed | | Loan Tenure (Original) | LMS – Loan Master | In days, for SLM denominator | | Waiver Amount | LMS – Waiver Log | Partial or full waiver on fee | | Waiver Date | LMS – Waiver Log | Date waiver was applied | | Waiver Type | LMS – Waiver Log | Partial /

## #119 — Approved Scrips productisation
**Status:** Pending review | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
We are solving for:

- A governed, audited maker-checker flow for all approved scrip updates in Command Centre
- Support for the following scrip operations via this flow:
    - **Approve new ISIN** — add a new ISIN (Mutual fund or Share) to the approved scrip with all required parameters
    - **Stop new lodgements** — set min LTV to zero for an ISIN (blocks new pledges without impacting existing 

# Approved Scrips productisation Last Edited: May 8, 2026 12:03 PM PRD ETA: April 21, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context The approved scrip list is the master reference that controls which ISINs can be pledged as collateral in the LMS, and at what LTV. It has two layers: - **Finflux approved scrip** — Global NBFC-level list managed in the LMS (Finflux). Stores min LTV and max LTV per ISIN and enforces that no lodged collateral exceeds max LTV. (Min LTV for default LTV value, Max LTV as a ceiling validation) - Finflux max LTV should be equal to Risk LTV and Finflux min LTV should be equal to Fenix min LTV - **Fenix approved scrip** — Internal list managed at a co-lender relationship (contract) level (colending vs non-colending) and product level (LAS and LAMF). Fenix carries three LTV values per ISIN: Regulatory LTV (= max LTV), Risk LTV (internal ceiling set by the risk team, ≤ Regulatory LTV), and Min LTV. Today, updates to both scrips require manually calling APIs in Fenix and Finflux separately. This is done by anyone with API access and without any audit trail, approval gate, or role-based control. **Who is affected:** - Risk ops team (makers) who need to update scrips frequently but have no safe, governed tool to do so - Risk managers (checkers) who have no visibility into what changed, when, and by whom - End users and LSPs who are indirectly impacted by incorrect LTV values (inflated or deflated offers, wrong shortfall calculations) **What is broken today:** - Fenix and Finflux scrips are updated separately and can fall out of sync — they should be updated atomically - Direct API updates are error-prone. A documented past incident set LTVs to 50 instead of 50% causing 100x limit inflation - No audit log exists for scrip changes — there is no way to trace who changed what and when - No role-based control — anyone with API access can make changes with immediate live impact on offer generation and shortfall computation **Why it matters now — three upcoming catalysts:** 1. **Colending expansion** — More colending relationships mean more contract-level approved scrip variants, increasing change frequency 2. **LTV increase to 70%** — Moving from 45% to 70% introduces higher risk volatility and requires more frequent scrip tuning by the risk team 3. **Loan against Shares launch** — Shares are more

## #120 — BRD Enhancements to Schedule & Derived Details Pro
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

# BRD: Enhancements to Schedule & Derived Details Processing for OD (Loan Against Mutual Funds) Last Edited: December 11, 2025 2:41 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **1. Problem Statement** Our OD product relies heavily on Finflux’s **schedule** and **schedule-derived details** for: - Accurate repayment allocation - DPD computation - Interest/charge tracking - Reconciliation, reporting (internal and external) Currently, certain system behaviours in the LMS lead to **incomplete or incorrect schedule updates**, which introduces reconciliation gaps and incorrect ageing/DPD calculations. We need Finflux to enhance how the LMS **creates, updates, and settles obligations** and **populates derived details** whenever specific transactions occur. --- ## **2. Context: How It Should Work (High Level)** - Any due created on a line (interest, charge, fee, penalty) should create an **obligation** in the schedule. - Currently we do not get the source transaction that created that obligation, we require source transaction to be mapped with the schedule ID so that we can directly map the transactions that created the corresponding schedule - When a transaction settles that obligation, the schedule and derived details should reflect: - obligation met - amount accounted - linkage to the transaction identifier - timestamps for audit - For OD products, interest accrues daily and becomes due only under certain events (billing, foreclosure (clear dues) etc.). Finflux already follows this pattern for regular repayments. The gaps occur only for specific transaction types listed below. --- ## **3. Issues & Required Enhancements** --- ## **3.1 Issue 1: *Clear Dues (used for Foreclosure) does not update schedule or derived details*** ### **Current Behaviour** - During foreclosure, Fenix performs a **“clear dues”** transaction to make the accrued interest due for the line: - Accrued-but-not-yet-due interest is first made due. - Finflux then settles this newly created due using excess funds when the clear dues API is hit - However: - The **schedule table is not updated** to reflect the new temporary obligation. - The **obligation is not marked as met**. - **Derived details** are not populated with the settlement transaction. ### **Impact** - Reporting discrepancies (interest recognised vs. interest settled). - Incorrect DPD because obligations appear “unmet”. ### **Required Behaviour** Finflux should: 1. **Create an obligation** in the schedule whenever clear-dues makes an amount due (accrued interest or any charge). 2. **Immediately settle the obligation** and mark: - obligation_met = true - obligation_met_on = timestamp 3. **Populate derived details** with: - linkage to the

**In scope:**
- Refund of interest already posted and/or collected
- Refund processed only via Credit Note (Interest type)
- Support for partial and full interest refunds
- Integrated accounting and LMS impact
- Duplicate refund control with necessary dedupe validations

# BRD: Interest Refund via Credit Note - OD - V2 Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Objective Interest is periodically accrued, posted, and collected from users as part of the OD loan lifecycle and recognized as interest income in the accounting system. In certain business scenarios (pricing corrections, excess collection, grievance redressal, operational errors, etc.), a portion of already posted and/or collected interest may need to be refunded to the user. The objective of this document is to define a **system-driven, auditable mechanism** to process interest refunds via Credit Note with correct accounting treatment. The solution must ensure: - Accurate reversal of interest income in P&L - Correct user-level balance adjustment - Elimination of manual accounting interventions - Full audit traceability --- ## 2. Scope ### In Scope - Refund of interest already posted and/or collected - Refund processed only via Credit Note (Interest type) - Support for partial and full interest refunds - Integrated accounting and LMS impact - Duplicate refund control with necessary dedupe validations ### Out of Scope - Interest waiver before posting --- ## 3. Key Definitions | Term | Definition | | --- | --- | | Interest Refund | Reversal of interest already posted and/or collected | | Credit Note (Interest) | LMS transaction representing interest refund | | Interest Income Reversal A/c | Contra-income GL used to reverse recognised interest revenue | --- ## 4. Accounting Principles Interest refunds will follow a **single-step integrated accounting construct**. At the time of Credit Note processing: - User balance adjustment and income reversal will occur simultaneously - No intermediate liability or clearing account will be created - P&L impact will be immediate This ensures: - LMS reflects user truth - Accounting reflects financial truth - Reduced reconciliation complexity - No deferred clearing entries --- ## 5.

# BRD: Interest Refund via Credit Note - OD Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM --- ## 1. Background & Objective Interest is periodically accrued, posted, and collected from users as part of the loan lifecycle and recognized as **interest income** in the accounting system. In specific business scenarios, a portion of **already posted and/or collected interest** may need to be reversed and refunded to the user. Currently, interest refunds are handled manually or via ad-hoc adjustments, which introduces: - Accounting inconsistencies - Limited audit traceability - Operational risk at scale ### Objective Define a **system-driven, auditable** mechanism to refund interest via **Credit Note**, ensuring: - Correct P&L reversal of interest income - Correct user balance adjustment - Alignment with existing Credit Note & Waiver accounting patterns --- ## 2.

**Solution:**
?**

We will be creating a charge waiver task for command centre which will behave in the following manner:

- If a charge is completely outstanding, that is the amount that was applied has not been collected from the user, will be waived.
- If a charge is completely paid/collected from the user, we will be passing a credit note to the user’s loan account

🚨

If a charge is partially paid/collected, we will not allow it to be waived or refunded - (Validation error). - We will now be passing a credit note for this as well

- If a charge is partially paid/collected, we will not allow it to be waived or refunded - (Validation error).

We will be creating a new payment type called “CREDIT_NOTE” this repayment will not have a corresponding money transaction associated with it.

**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Today, waiving or refunding charges was manual, operationally intensive, and people-dependent. With the charge reversal enhancement now built and deployed, we have eliminated dependency on engineering/backend intervention, reduced friction for internal teams, and improved customer resolution time.

This PRD documents the final implemented solution — including the maker/checker workflow, credit note processing, validations, accounting flows, and the enhancements required to support charges with no GST and the productisation manual JV transaction posting

---

**Solution:**
?**

All components below are **implemented and live**.

We have created a **Charge Refund Maker/Checker workflow** that behaves as follows:

- **If a charge is completely outstanding** → it is waived.
- **If a charge is completely collected/paid** → a **Credit note** is issued to the loan account.
- **If a charge is partially collected** → a **Credit note** is issued to the loan account.

A new repayment type **“Credit note”** is now supported in LMS.

This repayment *does not* trigger any cash movement. Operations uses this type for reconciliation visibility.

The first set of supported use cases now live:

- Processing fees
- Margin pledge charges
- Dishonour fees
    
    (All as configured under ADHOC charges)

# Corporate action - Data feed Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # Corporate Actions Data Feed ## Overview To support monitoring of securities pledged as collateral, we have reviewed a **Corporate Actions data feed sourced from BSE end-of-day bulletins**. This feed provides information on **events and disclosures that may impact the value, structure, or tradability of securities**. The data is consumed daily and can be used by the Risk team to monitor portfolio changes and identify events that may require action. The data covers the following broad categories: - Corporate action events - Company structural changes - Market disclosures - Large market transactions - Insider activity - Liquidity indicators --- # 1. Corporate Action Events This dataset contains information about **corporate actions declared by listed companies** that may affect the number of shares, price, or entitlement of shareholders. Typical corporate actions include: - Dividends - Stock splits - Bonus issues - Rights issues - Buybacks - Capital restructuring events For each event, the feed provides key reference dates such as: - **Record Date** – Date used to determine shareholder eligibility - **Ex-Date** – Date after which the security trades without the entitlement - **Cum Date** – Date before which investors must hold shares to be eligible - **Effective Dates** – Time period during which the action is applicable In addition, where applicable, the feed also provides: - Dividend amount or payout value - Share conversion ratios (e.g., split or bonus ratios) - Share quantity adjustments - Offer price or premium for rights issues These events are critical for adjusting **collateral valuation and share quantities** in pledged portfolios. --- # 2. Corporate Action Classification A separate master dataset provides the **mapping of corporate action identifiers to the specific event type** (e.g., dividend, split, bonus).

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

DSP currently captures consents as 2-3 line items. This is mostly restricted to email and mobile verification. None of the other consents in the journey are recorded in our DB from an audit trail perspective.

As per DPDP act, REs need to capture consent for data that’s absolutely required and more importantly store and mange it in a structured manner. This would require DSP to revoke consents if not applicable or not required as per policy. This would require DSP to maintain a strong audit trail for each consent in the journey.

# Disbursement simulation - LMS Last Edited: May 22, 2026 3:49 PM PRD ETA: May 5, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context - **Who is affected** - Borrowers using Volt (DSP Finance's LSP) who initiate withdrawal requests from their Loan Against Mutual Fund (LAMF) accounts. - All LSP partners integrated with DSP Finance's disbursement infrastructure. - DSP Finance's Risk Operations team, who are exposed to collateral shortfall risk when disbursements breach the safe limit. - **What is broken today** - The current Available Limit calculation — `AL = min(DP, SL) - POS + EM` does not account for accrued interest, charges, or scenarios where non-principal exposure grows to exceed the margin held against collateral. Two specific scenarios expose DSP Finance to risk: - **Case 1 — Collateral Removal:** After a borrower repays principal and requests maximum collateral removal, the remaining collateral may only cover the Drawing Power. Any subsequent withdrawal creates a situation where accrued interest (once booked as Interest Due) pushes total exposure above collateral value. - **Case 2 — Voluntary Sell-off:** After a sell-off settles principal, the sell-off proceeds inflate Excess Money, which inflates the Available Limit. A borrower can withdraw this excess, creating a POS that, combined with accrued interest becoming due, exceeds the remaining collateral value. - Today, the Loan Detail API value is trusted by all downstream systems (Fenix, Volt, and LSP partners) as the authoritative available limit. There is no pre-disbursement validation layer that applies the updated risk-safe AL formula before funds are transferred. - **Why it matters** - Collateral shortfall represents direct credit risk for DSP Finance — in cases of default, outstanding dues cannot be fully recovered. - The gap grows over time as accrued interest compounds, making early intervention critical. - LSP partners rely on the available limit shown to borrowers; without a simulation gate, disbursements that breach exposure limits will be processed without any check. --- ## 1.

## #133 — Dishonour charge enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Dishonour charges are applied to user loan accounts when monthly dues are not paid before the 7th of the month. However, the current application is tied to the outcome of mandate presentation, which results in inconsistent charge application across accounts.

**Problems Identified**

1. **Missed Charges Due to No Mandate:**
    
    Dishonour charges are **not applied** to users who do not have an active mandate (e.g., revoked mandates), even if they miss their due date.
    
2. **Incorrect Charges Despite Repayment:**
    
    Users who have already paid their dues manually

**Solution:**
?**

To make the application of dishonour charges **independent of the mandate presentation process** by introducing a post-due date review mechanism that ensures charges are applied fairly and consistently based on actual repayment behaviour.d

**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# FD: Fixerra Last Edited: December 1, 2025 2:13 PM ### Product Alignment Note – Fixerra FD Offering via Partner Dashboard *(DSP Finance × Volt Platform)* --- ### **Problem statement** Volt x DSP have a strong distribution via IFAs, we want to experiment distribution of different products via this channel, because of DSP Finance (NBFC) is looking to expand its retail investment footprint beyond LAMF (Loan Against Mutual Funds) by introducing a Fixed Deposit (FD) product. On the Volt platform today, distributors (primarily MFDs) only have LAMF as the monetizable product. While LAMF has strong unit economics, it is not a top-of-funnel product for retail customers. Fixerra provides the underlying FD product and infrastructure. The hypothesis is: - We already have arms-reach access to a large base of customers with mutual fund holdings. - These customers have a natural affinity for low-risk investment instruments. - FDs can act as a trust-building, widely accepted entry product, opening the funnel for both direct revenue (FD) and future LAMF conversions. This note outlines the scope for v1 of FD origination and servicing through the Volt Partner Dashboard, and is intended to align stakeholders across DSP Finance, Volt, and Fixerra. --- ### 2. Problem statement ### 2.1 Current state - MFDs on Volt can only offer LAMF. - Monetization is limited to one product with a relatively narrow target audience. - No simple “safe” product exists to attract or engage a wider customer base. - Distributors lack tools to deepen customer relationships beyond MF transactions. ### 2.2 Opportunity Introducing FDs: - Expands the product portfolio for MFDs. - Helps create a trust-led entry point (“mouth of the funnel”), improving conversions into higher-ticket products like LAMF. - Offers DSP Finance a scalable retail deposit base. - Allows Fixerra to distribute its FD product through MFD networks. --- ### 3. Product hypothesis **FDs can become a high-trust, low-friction product that increases distributor engagement and revenue, while simultaneously opening the pipeline for LAMF upsell.** Supporting hypotheses: 1. Customers with MF holdings are more likely to evaluate FD products with high confidence. 2. MFDs will be able to deepen their relationship and improve overall earnings by offering a broader product suite. 3. The NBFC can explore differentiated FD structuring based on distribution performance (for example, special rates, bulk programs). --- ### 4.

# Finflux Product Setup for Co-Lending Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: January 27, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Context As part of the co-lending setup, loans are economically split between: - **10% exposure (CLA portion)** - **90% exposure (TCL)** - **100% loan representation** required for operational and accounting purposes Current state: - Finflux is running on a **single instance** supporting **OD and TL products** - All reporting, accounting, SMA/NPA tagging, and operational workflows are currently **instance-scoped** - Finflux manages collateral and exposure deduplication The setup needs to support: - Fast go-live - Clean accounting - Correct delinquency signaling to TCL - Minimal disruption to existing production flows --- ## 2. Problem Statement The co-lending structure introduces multiple complexities: - **Collateral deduplication risk** if multiple loans referencing the same securities exist in the same instance - **Client-level SMA/NPA contagion**, where delinquency in a small CLA exposure may impact unrelated production loans - **Accounting segregation** required across different exposure types - **Operational overhead** introduced by multiple Finflux instances - **Reporting and reconciliation complexity** across LMS, Finflux, and TCL --- ## 3. Design Options Considered ### Option A: Single Finflux Instance with Multiple Products - All co-lending loans (10% and 100%) reside in the same instance - Separation handled purely via product-level configurations **Challenges** - High risk of collateral dedupe conflicts - Client-level NPA impact across all loans - Heavy reliance on product-level filters across reporting and accounting - Higher regression risk for existing OD and TL products --- ### Option B: Multiple Finflux Instances for All Co-Lending Loans - Separate instances for 10% and 100% loans **Challenges** - Higher setup and maintenance effort - Configuration and version-sync risks - Increased reporting and reconciliation overhead - Multiple operational points of failure at launch --- ## 4. Final Recommendation (Chosen Approach) **Recommended Setup** - **10% co-lending loan (CLA exposure)** → Booked in the **existing Finflux instance** - **100% loan** → Booked in a **separate Finflux instance** - **90% exposure** → Booked in **TCL** This approach optimizes for **lower effort, faster go-live, and controlled risk**, while keeping core production flows isolated. --- ## 5.

In a Loan Against Securities (LAS) setup, collateral positions are dynamic — securities can be lien marked, revoked, confiscated, or impacted by corporate actions at any time. For the NBFC, accurate and timely tracking of these changes is critical to:

- **Maintain exposure** by ensuring only lien-marked securities are considered as collateral.

# LAS: Collateral management system Last Edited: July 28, 2025 8:43 PM PRD ETA: June 27, 2025 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **What is CMS?** The Collateral Management System (CMS) will act as the central infrastructure for managing pledged shares for a Loan Against Shares (LAS) product. It will interface with the Loan Origination System (LOS), Loan Management System (LMS), and Depository Participant (DP) — SHCIL — to manage the full lifecycle of collateral from validation to lien marking, valuation, revocation, and reconciliation. It will also include risk management via real-time LTV monitoring, handling of corporate actions, and tools for operations teams. [CMS system architecture](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b5a68c3c-4705-4c9d-b34b-52a1d6bb8ec4) --- # Why do we need a CMS? A **Collateral Management System (CMS)** is essential for a **Loan Against Shares (LAS)** product because collateral (in the form of pledged shares) is **the core security** backing the loan. Without an automated, secure, and integrated system to manage this collateral, the business is exposed to **operational risk, financial risk, and regulatory gaps**. 1. Centralised tracking and management of collaterals: Currently all collaterals are managed by the LMS which makes it very risk prone: A CMS ensures each step is trackable, audit-logged, and consistent with external systems (DP/SHCIL) and internal ones (LMS/LOS). 2. CMS constantly monitors Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios. If share prices fall, LTV breaches can be automatically flagged (exposure tracking), triggering margin calls or partial lien revocation. 3. Logic separation from LMS: CMS has a lot of collateral management intelligence which should be LMS agnostic, this will make our LMS very modular and easily replaceable since majority of the complexity of collateral management will be handled via CMS. --- # **How are others solving this problem?** The approach to collateral management for Loan Against Shares (LAS) varies widely across the lending ecosystem, largely depending on a company’s scale, tech maturity, and risk appetite. Broadly, solutions fall into two categories: ### 1. **Tightly Coupled CMS-LMS Systems (Usually Vendor-Provided)** Some lenders use **end-to-end lending platforms** where the CMS is embedded within the LMS — often provided by a third-party vendor. These platforms offer: - Pre-integrated lien workflows - Basic LTV tracking - Unified borrower and collateral view ### 2. **No CMS — Operations-Led Collateral Tracking** Most early-stage or mid-sized lenders operate without a dedicated CMS. Instead, they rely on: - Manual **ops processes** to initiate and track lien/revocation files - **Excel sheets or shared dashboards** to monitor pledged ISINs

Key principles: - A **combined DP account** is maintained per customer, but **collateral operations are asset-specific**. - **RMS (Risk Management System)** provides real-time valuation (15-min intervals), while **LMS (Loan Management System)** runs off daily NAVs or EOD market prices. - All DP negative impact money and collateral transactions are **double-validated by LMS + RMS** to ensure real-time coverage, DP sufficiency. --- ## **1. MONEY TRANSACTIONS** --- ### **1.1 Disbursement (Forward + Reverse)** - **Forward Disbursement:** - Triggered post approval and sufficient DP validation (LMS) - RMS validates real-time prices (every 15 minutes). - LMS validates EOD price consistency - Both systems must independently confirm DP sufficiency. - On success: disbursement request is sent to TSP; loan status updated. (Cashfree) - **Reverse Disbursement:** - Used in cases of failed payout - Transaction reversed, collateral DP recalculated. --- ### **1.2 Repayment (Forward + Reverse)** - **Forward Repayment:** - Triggered via user mandate or manual repayment (UPI/netbanking/DC/VA) - LMS receives repayment; validates against due and excess amounts. - **Reverse Repayment:** - Applicable when repayment fails due to banking errors or incorrect credit. - LMS adjusts ledger and reverses credit. --- ### **1.3 Excess Refund** - LMS calculates overpayment (e.g., duplicate repayment, excess interest). - Refund is initiated after checking **updated DP position** via (RMS + LMS) - Final payout initiated via TSP only when RMS confirms buffer post-refund. --- ### **1.4 Charge Application (Forward + Waiver + Refund)** - **Forward:** - Charges (processing, penal charge, Dishonour fees) posted via LMS on configured triggers. - **Waiver:** - Ops-triggered waiver requests. - **Refund:** - Charge reversed, and refund processed. (Credit note) --- ## **2. SERVICING** --- ### **2.1 Closure** - Triggered after full repayment and complete collateral release. - LMS validates: - Zero principal (LMS) - No pending charges (LMS) - No open collateral pledges (CMS) - Closure confirmation sent to DP, TSP, and customer. --- ### **2.2 Renewal** - Applicable for LAMF/LAS products with fixed-term limits. - At maturity, a renewal window opens. --- ### **2.3 Mobile / Email / Bank Account Update

# LMS: Multiple sell off requests Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: January 16, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Context In the current LAS / LAMF sell-off flow, the system allows **only one non-terminal sell-off request per loan** at any point in time. Operationally, this breaks in real-world scenarios where: - Sell-off is raised across **multiple funds** and one or more invocations **fail partially** at the RTA / AMC level - Failed invocations do not cover the **entire overdue or shortfall** - Ops is forced to raise **another sell-off request** while the earlier one is still in progress or stuck (Which is currently blocked by a validation that only one non terminal request is allowed). This leads to: - Manual workarounds by the engineering team to support the use case - Delays in curing shortfall / overdue - Risk of exposure breach if sell-off cannot be retriggered in time - Risk of incorrect updates by the engineering team --- ## 2. Problem Statement **Ops raises a sell-off request for multiple securities.** - Some invocations succeed - One or more invocations fail or get stuck (e.g. CAMS / KFIN issues) - Proceeds received are **insufficient to cover the shortfall** - System blocks Ops from raising another sell-off request due to an existing non-terminal request This creates a deadlock where: - Exposure remains unresolved - Ops cannot act despite legitimate need - Manual intervention becomes necessary --- ## 3. Current Sell-Off Flow (As-Is) 1. **Sell-off Initiation** - Ops raises sell-off via **Bulk Maker** at **collateral level** - Requests are consolidated at **loan level** - A single sell-off request is created per loan 2. **Blocking Logic** - Selected units are blocked in LMS - Blocked units stop contributing to **Drawing Power (DP)** 3. **Threshold Calculation** ``` AvailableThreshold= DP - POS - COS - IOS - Accrued Interest ``` - Blocking ensures: - No excess collateral release - No further disbursement beyond safe exposure 4. **Invocation Flow** - RTA APIs (CAMS / KFIN) invoked - RTAs pass requests to AMCs - AMC sells securities 5. **Settlement & Reconciliation** - Proceeds credited to NBFC bank account - Settlement TAT: 2–3 working days - Ops reconciles proceeds via bulk operation - Proceeds mapped to collateral sell-off requests - Amount posted to respective loan accounts in LMS --- ## 4. Key Issue in Current Design - System enforces **single non-terminal

## #148 — LSP Presentation enhancement for externally regist
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, all mandate registrations for DSP Finance are done internally through our TSP (Digio) integration. As we onboard LSP partners like Smallcase, there is a need for them to independently initiate mandate registration flows while still maintaining DSP Finance’s sponsor bank credentials.

This enhancement allows Smallcase to register mandates on behalf of DSP Finance, improving the customer experience by reducing redirects and enabling a native flow within the LSP app.

However, since mandates will be registered from the partner’s Digio account, DSP will not have direc

**Solution:**
?**

We will extend mandate registration capability to Smallcase via Digio by sharing DSP’s sponsor bank configuration. Smallcase will have restricted access — limited only to mandate registration (not cancellation or presentation).

Post successful registration, Smallcase will call submitMandateDetails API to push the mandate details to DSP for internal record-keeping and tagging.

During future mandate presentations, if the mandate is tagged as external, DSP will additionally pass bank_account and ifsc in the presentation request since these details are unavailable within DSP’s Digio account context.

## #149 — Loan cancellation - No cost EMI TL (Cred)
**Status:** Pending review | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Loan cancellation - No cost EMI / TL (Cred) Last Edited: May 26, 2026 9:08 PM PRD ETA: May 26, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora --- ## Background and context ### Who is facing the problem - Borrowers who have taken a No Cost EMI loan against a merchant purchase and subsequently return the product or drop off mid-journey. - Borrowers who have an Insurance Premium Financing (IPF) loan where the insurance policy is cancelled either by the insurer or by the borrower. - CRED TL customers who have taken a loan and want to cancel within the loan cancellation period. - Ops and collections teams who currently have no automated lifecycle event for cancellation, distinct from foreclosure. - Risk teams who need cancelled loans excluded from bureau reporting which requires a distinct CANCELLED status, not CLOSED. ### What is broken today - There is no cancellation event in the current loan lifecycle. Cancellation and foreclosure are conflated, which creates incorrect P&L treatment, incorrect bureau reporting, and incorrect charge recovery. - When a merchant initiates a product return, there is no clean mechanism to unwind the loan, waive obligations, and return collected funds to the borrower. - Excess parking at line level does not work for cancelled tranches because excess needs to be tagged to the specific cancelled tranche for the refund to be correctly attributed. ### Why it matters - **Bureau reporting:** loans cancelled due to product return or policy cancellation must not be reported to credit bureaus. This requires a distinct CANCELLED status that bureau reporting logic can filter on. - **P&L accuracy:** interest waiver on cancellation must be treated as an income reversal, not a write-off. Without a proper cancellation flow, P&L entries are incorrect. - **Customer experience:** borrowers who return products or cancel policies are entitled to a refund of collected amounts. Without this flow, refunds are manual and error-prone. --- ## 1. Problem scope | In scope | Out of scope | | --- | --- | | No Cost EMI (NCEMI) term loan tranche cancellation | Foreclosure (separate flow — live) | | Insurance Premium Financing (IPF) loan cancellation | Partial cancellation | | All four obligation state scenarios (see Section 3) | Borrower-unilateral cancellation (enforced at Fenix layer) | | Configurable cancellation window (beyond 14 days) | Merchant settlement and MMS integration (Fenix layer) | | Obligation-level configurability for waiver and refund

## #153 — PPSL UPI mandate presentation
**Status:** Pending review | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
The scope of this enhancement includes:

- Supporting UPI mandate registration through PPSL for PayTM-originated users
- Enhancing LOS mandate registration APIs to support explicit provider tagging
- Allowing PayTM to explicitly pass `provider = PPSL`
- Persisting provider information within LOS
- LMS consuming provider metadata from LOS
- LMS routing mandate presentation based on provider
- Suppo

# PPSL UPI mandate presentation Last Edited: May 25, 2026 10:00 PM PRD ETA: May 25, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **Background and Context** PayTM currently uses the existing DSP Finance (Fenix) mandate registration and presentation stack for both NACH and UPI mandates, where mandate registration is facilitated via Digio and mandate presentation is managed through DSP Finance workflows. PayTM intends to migrate mandate registration for a subset of users to the internal PPSL mandate stack. The primary motivation behind this change is to significantly improve the end-user registration experience by enabling native invocation of the UPI intent flow directly through the PayTM ecosystem. This removes dependency on external redirection-heavy flows and improves TPAP handoff reliability during mandate registration. Historically, the PPSL UPI mandate presentation workflow differed from the existing Digio-integrated flow: - Digio workflow: - Single consolidated API call - Automatically registers PDN and presents mandate together - Mandatory condition that mandate presentation occurs more than 24 hours in the future - PPSL workflow (earlier implementation): - PDN scheduling and mandate presentation were independent APIs/workflows - Required additional orchestration effort from LMS/LOS PPSL has now aligned its APIs and shared updated documentation enabling the required orchestration compatibility. However, this introduces an operational and technical challenge: - Certain PayTM customers will continue using Digio mandates - New customers may register mandates using PPSL - LMS presentation logic must identify which mandate provider was used during registration to correctly invoke downstream presentation workflows Currently, LOS internally maintains provider mapping through a provider column, however the external mandate registration APIs used by LSPs do not allow explicit provider selection. This creates ambiguity for LMS while determining presentation routing. To solve this, the mandate registration APIs will be enhanced to allow PayTM to explicitly pass the mandate provider during registration. --- # **1. Problem Scope** ## In Scope The scope of this enhancement includes: - Supporting UPI mandate registration through PPSL for PayTM-originated users - Enhancing LOS mandate registration APIs to support explicit provider tagging - Allowing PayTM to explicitly pass `provider = PPSL` - Persisting provider information within LOS - LMS consuming provider metadata from LOS - LMS routing mandate presentation based on provider - Supporting coexistence of: - Legacy Digio mandates - PPSL mandates - Maintaining the existing UPI mandate presentation logic at LMS layer: - Loan account level presentation creation - Collection batch item generation - Existing downstream presentation

# Part payments - No cost EMI / TL (Cred) Last Edited: May 22, 2026 11:34 AM PRD ETA: May 22, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and context ### Who is facing the problem - Borrowers with active TL tranches under a credit line who wish to reduce their repayment burden, improve collateral coverage, or avoid forced liquidation of pledged securities. - Collections teams who need a structured tool to help distressed borrowers reduce delinquency probability without full foreclosure. - Risk and ops teams who currently have no automated principal-reduction pathway and handle these requests manually. ### What is broken today - Borrowers have no self-serve mechanism to make a partial principal repayment against a tranche. - The only options available are full EMI payment, excess parking at line level, or full foreclosure — none of which address the mid-path use case of reducing outstanding principal while keeping the tranche live. - Excess parking, while improving the shortfall formula on paper, does not reduce tranche-level obligations. Borrowers who park excess as a shortfall cure remain exposed to re-triggering if security values drop further. - Collections teams have no product-supported tool to recommend structured partial paydowns as part of a repayment sustainability plan. ### Why it matters - Forced liquidation of pledged securities is a high-friction, high-cost event for both borrower and lender. A structured part payment pathway can prevent this. - Borrowers with temporary liquidity (bonus, redemption, salary inflow) have no way to deploy it productively against their loan exposure. - Without this, borrowers approaching shortfall thresholds have only two outcomes: excess parking (fragile cure) or sell-off. Part payment creates a third, durable path. --- ## 1.

Every day, over 200 customers apply for a loan. For 4–5 of these customers, the pincode is missing in Finflux, our core lending platform. Currently, adding a missing pincode requires raising a support ticket to the Finflux team, which takes 3–4 working hours.

This manual dependency directly delays account opening, increases operational overhead, and negatively affects the customer experience and turnaround time (TAT).

We must ensure that borrowers **explicitly acknowledge the risks and operational mechanics of pledged securities** to maintain compliance, risk, and operational coverage for taking necessary collection actions if the market falls significantly. Regulatory expectations from **SEBI (pledge of securities framework)** and **RBI digital lending guidelines** require lenders to ensure: - Customers provide **explicit consent for pledge enforcement and liquidation of securities**. - Customers acknowledge **market-linked risks** associated with pledged securities. - Customers consent to **digital communication and electronic execution of records**. - Lenders ensure the borrower **is not pledging promoter-held securities**, which may be subject to additional regulatory restrictions. Currently, the onboarding journey **does not capture an explicit promoter declaration nor structured consent acknowledgement**.

This enhancement addresses the following problems.

# Product Note: Penalty migration to Fenix (Colending) Last Edited: April 14, 2026 4:02 PM PRD ETA: March 15, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **Background and Context** Currently, penal charges for overdue loan accounts are computed by an **automated job in Finflux**. This job runs daily at 4 AM and applies penalties when interest becomes overdue. These charges are stored as **applicable charges in Finflux** and surfaced to downstream systems primarily through foreclosure simulations. This architecture introduces several operational and product limitations. **Who is impacted** - Operations teams - Product and engineering teams - Finance and customer support teams - Borrowers indirectly (through slower issue resolution) **Challenges in the current setup** 1. **Limited product control** Penal charge computation logic currently resides inside Finflux jobs. Any change to the logic requires dependency on Finflux configuration and third party coordination. 2. **Limited configurability** The current implementation applies a **flat penalty of ₹10 per day**, whereas the Key Fact Statement (KFS) requires **slab-based penalty computation based on overdue amount**. (This is a compliance observation) 3. **No operational control** Since penalties are not created as **transactions inside Fenix (internal LMS)**: - Operations cannot **waive or refund penalties directly** - Charge-level audit and tracking are difficult 4. **Colending complexity** In Loan-90 / Loan-10 structures, penalties must be **orchestrated across loan legs**. The Finflux-driven penalty logic does not provide sufficient control to ensure accurate charge allocation across colending loans. 5. **Foreclosure simulation dependency** Foreclosure calculations rely on Finflux charge simulations. This makes enhancements difficult and increases dependency on an external system for a critical borrower-facing calculation (Finflux). Additionally, the current system lacks a **generalised framework for defining and applying loan charges**. Future charges such as **Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC)** or other contingent fees would require ad-hoc implementations. This enhancement addresses these limitations by: - Migrating **penal charge computation to Fenix** - Introducing a **generic Applicable Charges framework** - Enabling **charge-level operational controls** - Supporting **future charge types such as AMC** --- # **1. Problem Scope** ## **In Scope** This enhancement addresses the following problems. ### **Migration of penalty computation to Fenix** Daily penal charge computation will move from **Finflux jobs to Fenix**, eliminating system dependency and enabling full product control. ### **Penalty pricing enhancement** Penalty logic will be enhanced from **flat charges to slab-based pricing**, as defined in the KFS. ### **Minimum overdue threshold** Penalties will only be applied when: Overdue Amount ≥ ₹10 This

# Product note: Foreclosure (Colending) Last Edited: May 19, 2026 2:47 PM PRD ETA: March 15, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **Background and Context** Foreclosure is the process by which a borrower closes the loan account by repaying all outstanding dues including principal, interest, and applicable charges. In the current system architecture, loans are represented internally as **Loan 100**, while in a **colending setup** the exposure is split across: - **Loan 90 (NBFC exposure)** - **Loan 10 (Partner/Lender exposure)** Although Loan 100 represents the borrower-facing account, the underlying accounting and settlement obligations exist across **Loan 90 and Loan 10 in the Colending Loan Management System (CLMS)**. ### Who is impacted - Borrowers initiating foreclosure - Lending partners (colending participants) - Operations teams processing closures - Product and engineering teams responsible for transaction sequencing - Finance teams responsible for settlement and accounting ### What is broken today Foreclosure today largely operates based on **Loan 100 balances**, while the actual liabilities exist across **Loan 90 and Loan 10**. This creates several limitations: 1. **Incorrect foreclosure simulation** Foreclosure amounts may be computed using only Loan 100 data without validating Loan 90 and Loan 10 balances. 2. **Pending transaction inconsistencies** Foreclosure may be initiated even when **pending transactions exist in CLMS**, leading to inaccurate payoff calculations. 3. **Transaction sequencing issues** Loan closure and collateral release may occur without ensuring that: - Loan 90 and Loan 10 are closed - All charges and interest are posted - Excess settlement is completed 4. **Penalty and applicable charge dependency** Applicable charges (such as penal charges) may be applied after repayment due to **daily charge jobs**, which may cause foreclosure attempts to fail if charges are posted after repayment. 5. **Incorrect collateral release timing** Securities may be released before confirming that **both loan legs are closed**, which introduces risk. ### Why this is important Foreclosure is a **regulatory and customer-sensitive workflow**. Incorrect sequencing may lead to: - Incorrect payoff amounts shared with borrowers - Operational rework due to partial closures - Accounting mismatches across loan legs - Risk of releasing collateral before loan closure creating financial exposure for the NBFC This PRD defines a **colending foreclosure workflow** that ensures: - Correct payoff simulation - Transaction sequencing across loan legs - Controlled collateral release - Accurate excess settlement. --- # **1.

# Product note: Interest rate change handling Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:51 PM PRD ETA: March 19, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **Background and Context** In the current co-lending construct between DSP (NBFC) and TCL (co-lender), loans are originated and managed across multiple representations within the LMS: - **Loan 90 (TCL Book):** Represents TCL’s capital contribution and is controlled externally by TCL, including interest rate decisions. - **Loan 10 (DSP Book):** Represents DSP’s capital contribution and follows DSP’s internal benchmark and pricing logic. - **Loan 100 (Customer-facing Loan):** A composite loan created in the LMS, reflecting the borrower’s obligation and used for repayment schedules, accruals, and customer communication. The effective interest rate for the borrower is derived as a **weighted average of the underlying lender rates based on capital contribution**: - 90% → TCL (Loan 90) - 10% → DSP (Loan 10) However, from a system and implementation perspective: - The LMS treats **Loan 100 as an independent loan** with its own benchmark and ROI. - Interest rates are currently configured using **benchmark + spread constructs defined at an organizational level**. - There is **no native support for dynamic weighted rate computation** across multiple lender loans within the LMS. --- ### **Problem Statement** As part of ongoing co-lending operations: 1. **Independent Rate Changes by Lenders** - TCL may revise its interest rates (benchmark or spread) independently. - DSP may also revise its own benchmark rates. - These changes directly impact the **effective blended ROI** applicable to the borrower. 2. **Lack of Native Synchronization** - Since Loan 90, Loan 10, and Loan 100 are maintained separately: - Rate changes in Loan 90 (TCL) do not automatically reflect in Loan 100. - Loan 100 must be **manually or systematically updated** to maintain parity with the blended rate. 3. **Risk of Misalignment** - If Loan 90 and Loan 100 are not updated in sync: - Incorrect borrower interest may be charged. - Accruals and repayment splits between lenders may become inconsistent. - Downstream systems (accounting, reconciliation, reporting) may break. 4. **Operational Complexity** - Current benchmark configuration is **organization-wide**, not contract-specific. - With multiple co-lending partners, each having: - Different benchmarks - Different spreads - Different rate change cycles → A single benchmark approach does not scale. --- ### **Constraints** - Loan 100 **must exist as a physical loan in the LMS** and cannot be treated as a derived construct. - LMS

## #169 — Risk management system LAS
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

For loans against collateral with dynamically priced assets like:

- Shares
- Mutual funds

It becomes important to ensure that all transactions and exposure given out to user against loans committed by the NBFC, are validated. As of now only the LMS was responsible for doing these validations, but as our systems and products get more complex, there is an additional need for a separate system with logic separation to validate all transactions.

Traditionally, validation of disbursals, top-ups, sell-offs, or withdrawals was handled solely within the LMS (Loan Management Syste

**Solution:**
?**

The RMS module performs the following responsibilities:

- Ingest and store market data for all pledged securities every 15 minutes.
- Compute real-time LTV (Loan-to-Value) and exposure metrics using pledged quantity and live prices.
- Raise alerts for LTV or exposure breaches.
- Raise alerts to customers on exposure breaches
- Validate user transactions that may impact risk thresholds—like disbursals, release requests, or sell-offs—against real-time metrics before allowing execution.

## #170 — Shortfall Enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
We are solving for six interconnected problems across the shortfall calculation engine:

**A. Fair ageing treatment and correct Exposure definition**
Decompose incremental shortfall into ΔDP and ΔExposure components. Apply ΔExposure recovery independently (FIFO) before any ΔDP worsening creates a new shortfall instance. Exposure throughout the system = POS + Interest Overdue.

**B. Daily shortfall

# Shortfall Enhancement Last Edited: May 6, 2026 2:55 PM PRD ETA: April 23, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) and Loan Against Shares (LAS) are secured credit products where customers pledge securities as collateral. The Drawing Power (DP) — the maximum permissible loan amount — is a function of the market value of the pledged collateral after applying the applicable LTV. A shortfall arises when the customer's Exposure (Principal Outstanding + Interest Overdue) exceeds DP. Shortfall management is a critical risk control function. Today it is broken in several ways that affect borrowers, the operations team, and the business's risk posture. **Who is affected:** - Borrowers who act in good faith — making repayments or pledging additional collateral — are being penalised because their recovery actions are netted against same-day market movements, stripping them of the ageing benefit they earned - Operations team who manually approve shortfall communications every morning, creating a bottleneck that prevents borrowers from receiving timely notice before markets open - Risk team who have no automated early-warning on severe collateral deterioration until it is too late to act same-day - LSPs who cannot offer a good borrower experience because the shortfall API doesn't expose due dates or the full picture of shortfall types **What is broken today — six specific gaps:** 1. **Ageing is not fair to borrowers.** The incremental shortfall is computed as a single net figure mixing market movements (ΔDP) and customer actions (ΔExposure). A borrower who repays ₹1L on a day the market falls ₹1.2L gets zero ageing benefit — the repayment is silently absorbed. Data shows this is material: across accounts in shortfall, 12% of borrowers at ageing 1 made repayments, 7.8% at ageing 2, 8.6% at ageing 3 — these customers deserved ageing credit that the current logic denies them. 2. **Shortfall does not run on non-market days.** When T is a market holiday, the shortfall job skips T+1 entirely. Borrowers who repaid on the holiday stay in shortfall on the platform for an extra day even though their account is clean — a bad experience with no financial basis. 3. **Interest overdue is excluded from Exposure.** Current shortfall logic only uses Principal Outstanding. RBI regulations require Exposure to be POS + Interest Overdue. This means shortfall is understated today. 4. **No reliable NAV gate.** The shortfall job and the NAV update

## #171 — Suspension framework
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?

Currently, suspensions or blacklisting actions (triggered by screening alerts, loan irregularities, or risk assessments) are handled inconsistently across different systems and entities within the NBFC. This fragmented approach creates several critical issues:

1. **Inconsistent Enforcement**: Different systems apply suspension logic differently, leading to gaps where suspended entities can still transact through certain channels
2. **`Missing Hierarchy Propagation**: When a customer is flagged at PAN level, the suspension doesn't automatically cascade to their existing leads,

## #178 — Transaction Sequencing & Transaction Workflows for
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
This document defines the **transaction orchestration logic across all supported transaction types**.

Specifically it covers:

# Transaction Sequencing & Transaction Workflows for Co-Lending LMS Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: March 10, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # Background and Context DSP Finance is implementing a **co-lending structure between DSP and TCL** where a single customer loan is operationally represented by **three loan accounts inside the LMS**. The loan accounts are structured as follows: - **Loan 100** → Customer facing orchestration loan (Finflux) - **Loan 90** → TCL lender loan (Swiffy LMS) - **Loan 10** → DSP lender loan (Finflux) All **customer-facing interactions and repayments occur on Loan 100**, while lender accounting and settlement must be reflected in the **individual lender loan books**. This PRD introduces the need for **systematic orchestration across multiple loan books** to ensure: - lender accounting reconciliation - schedule consistency - correct split of repayments - ransaction ordering - correct DP (Drawing Power) management --- ### Transaction Categories The system processes two categories of transactions. --- ## Money Transactions These impact loan balances or receivables. Examples: - Disbursement - Repayment - Refund / Disbursement reversal - Charge application - Charge knock off - Interest posting - Credit note adjustments - Waivers - Excess payment handling - Excess refunds - Clear dues transactions --- ## Collateral Transactions These impact collateral and **DP calculations**. Examples: - Add collateral - Remove collateral - Sell-off collateral Collateral operations may also **trigger money transactions**, such as: - Margin pledge charges - Invocation charges - Repayment from sell-off proceeds --- # Current Challenge The LMS currently processes transactions **independently per loan account** without orchestration across lender books. This introduces several operational risks in a co-lending structure. --- ## 1. Transaction Ordering Risk Example sequence: Repayment → Interest posting → Charge posting If these are processed **in different orders across lender loan books**, the share calculations become inconsistent. --- ## 2. Money Flow vs Accounting Mismatch Customer funds move through **escrow accounts**, while lender receivables are maintained in the LMS. Without deterministic orchestration: - escrow balances may move - lender books may not reconcile --- ## 3. Collateral and Money Transaction Race Conditions Example: Sell-off collateral and repayment arriving simultaneously. This may result in: - incorrect DP recalculation - incorrect sell-off triggers - incorrect available limit. --- ## 4. Partial Transaction Failures Example: Loan 100 disbursement succeeds but lender loan posting fails. This creates **partial system states** that break reconciliation. --- # Why Solving This

## #182 — [Platform] Decoupling of dishonour fees with manda
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently our dishonour charge application is coupled with mandate presentation, what that means is basis certain error codes that we get from Digio (presentation vendor), we either apply or do not apply dishonour charges

However that leaves the following gap, for customers where mandate was not registered, and presentation does not happen, we are not able to apply dishonour charges (which should have been applied).

How does scenarios arise where mandate is not registered for the user:

- User revokes existing mandate (cancels)
- User registers via Aadhaar Esign or Physica

**Solution:**
?**

We will be setting up a job on Finflux which will apply dishonour charges (Rs 590 - - 500 + GST) to users with interest overdue on the 8th of next month (Interest for January was posted on 1st Feb and was due on 7th Feb, dishonour fees if applicable will be posted on 8th Feb at 2 AM)

We will remove charge application logic from our mandate presentation workflow, mandate presentation will only post or not post transactions based on the status received from the vendor (extendable to current implementation with PhonePe)

## #183 — [Platform] Disbursement optimisation to handle cro
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As an NBFC one of the core aspects is to handle disbursements. Disbursement as a request as primarily two main components:

- Payout from the source bank account to the beneficiary bank account
- Posting of the transaction in the loan account of the user

While it seems pretty straightforward, there are multiple aspects that affect this workflow:

- Charge posting and knock off from disbursement requests
- Disbursement reversals

More about payouts:

Now payouts primarily have two cycles, debit cycle where the money is debited from the source bank account (NBFC bank account)

**Solution:**
?**

When a payout for a disbursement request placed in the previous billing cycle with a successful SOA posting in the previous billing cycle fails in the next billing cycle.

Change 1: Instead of reversing the payout as well as the corresponding knock off entry, we will be doing a partial return of the SOA posting.

Change 2: When a user places a withdrawal request, as a part of the workflow, we first knock off the charges, and then initiate the payout (sometimes it takes time for us to get confirmation on the payout cycle and the debit cycle in itself can fail) can cause similar instances as described in the problem statement where we are unable to reverse the charge knock off transaction post billing cycle

## #184 — [Platform] Foreclosure handling to support Volt fo
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

A loan account has the following particulars:

- Charges due
- Penal charges due
- Interest due
- Principal oustanding
- Interest accrued not due
- Excess

Whenever a user makes a repayment, it goes through a set apportionment strategy:

Interest overdue → Charges overdue → Interest due → Charge due → Principal outstanding → Excess

Note that the repayments cannot settle interest accrued as it is not due, interest accrued is posted at the end of the billing cycle (becomes due) and then can be settled either via making repayments or via mandate presentation to the user’s loan

**Solution:**
?**

We will allow the LSP to pass an optional parameter called (Is foreclosure payment) in the create repayment order request.

<aside>
🚨

Please note that we will not be validating the amount (and if it satisfies foreclosure validations) for the account

</aside>

For this repayments, there will be an additional step in the payment workflow for the following validation:

- If Excess amount ≥ Accrued interest and TOS=0, clear dues
- If Excess amount < Accrued interest or TOS≠0 then do not clear dues

<aside>
⚠️

Please note that these payments will not go through a checker approval workflow

We will be enhancing our current mandate presentation workflow to support the use case where an LSP will control the mandate presentation for the users and will have the following capabilities:

- Get mandate collection file: Mandate collection file which is generated every month and then approved by the operations team will be available as a file (csv) through a get API (for all eligible loan accounts for presentation) to the LSP with approval status
- Mandate collection posting API: LSP will have the capability to pass the mandate collection response to the user (broadly there can be the following scenarios)
    - Mandate was presented and collected successfully (Success)
    - Mandate was presented but failed (Fail)
    - Mandate was not presented (Pending) - LSP will not call the

## #187 — Term Loan Apportionment Logic
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Apportionment Logic - Apportionment is the distribution of a paid sum of money across multiple components of a loan/tranche in order to knock off/settle these components. - Apportionment logic will be based in the order of IPC. - In case of a single tranche apportionment the order will be: Interest Overdue>Principal Overdue>Interest Due>Principal Due>Charge. In case there are multiple EMIs of the Tranche which are overdue then apportionment will start from the oldest EMI overdue. - In case of multiple tranches apportionment the order will be: Oldest EMI overdue(Interest>Principal)>Oldest EMI due(Interest>Principal)>Charges. In case of EMIs overdue across multiple tranches the oldest EMI across tranches will be apportioned first then the apportioning will be done for the next oldest EMI across the tranches and so on so forth. In case all the overdue EMIs are cleared/apportioned the next apportioning will be done for the oldest due EMI and once the oldest due EMI is apportioned then apportioning of the next oldest due EMI will be done and so on so forth. Once all the overdue and due EMIs are apportioned across tranches, apportionment of charges will start and it will also be done based in the order of the oldest charge getting apportioned first i.e. in the chronological order. - If after the apportionment of all the components there is an excess which remains then we will ask the user to select the tranche wherein the excess will be adjusted. The excess adjustment will happen in a way that either the Tenure of the Tranche is reduced or the EMI of the Tranche is reduced based on the user’s selection. Default option(in case user does not select) will always be to reduce the tenure keeping the EMI same for the oldest Tranche.

## #191 — Term Loan DPD handling
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: DPD handling ## **Handling of Days Past Dues (DPD) for Overdue Tranches** ### **Definition of DPD** - **Days Past Due (DPD)** is the number of calendar days an EMI remains unpaid beyond its scheduled due date. - DPD shall be calculated **per tranche/EMI** and maintained at both: - **Tranche level** → to identify overdue EMIs. - **Loan account level** → to reflect overall delinquency status. --- ### **DPD Lifecycle & Tracking** - **0 DPD:** EMI due on the due date but not yet paid. - **1–13/18 DPD:** Period after the due date until the 2nd Mandate presentation. - **14/19 DPD onwards:** If the 2nd NACH also bounces, account enters persistent delinquency. - Post sell-off, if dues are cleared, DPD for corresponding tranches resets to **0**. - If sell-off proceeds are **insufficient**, DPD continues to accrue on residual overdue balance. --- ### **DPD & Apportionment Interaction** - When sell-off proceeds are received: 1. First, they are applied to the **oldest overdue tranche (highest DPD)**. 2. Within a tranche, proceeds are apportioned as: - Interest component → Principal component → Charges. 3. Once all overdue tranches are cleared, any remaining proceeds are applied towards: - Upcoming EMIs (not yet due), then - Loan-level excess balance. --- ### **DPD in Customer Communication(To be closed)** - Customer statements and notifications shall explicitly display: - Current DPD status per tranche. - Total overdue amount by DPD bucket (e.g., 1–30 days, 31–60 days). - Post-sell-off DPD reset (or residual overdue if sell-off insufficient). --- ### **Regulatory & Credit Bureau Reporting** - DPD values shall be reported to credit bureaus as per regulatory guidelines (CIBIL/Experian/Equifax). - If overdue persists beyond sell-off (due to insufficient collateral proceeds), the updated DPD must continue until full settlement. - Correct mapping of **tranche-level DPD → loan-level delinquency** must be ensured in reporting systems. --- ### **Exception Handling** - If AMC redemption is delayed (T+1/T+2), DPD continues to accrue until proceeds are actually realized. - In case of system error or partial sell-off, DPD is adjusted retrospectively once final proceeds are credited.

# Term Loan: Disbursement ### First Drawdown Based on the Submit opportunity status the subsequent flow will be decided: **Submit Opportunity Failure:** - Loan and Tranche Account won’t be created and LSP will have to re-trigger the request **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Success):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. - Our payout partner acknowledges the request and initiate the payout from their end. - Once the amount gets debited from our bank account we get a debit success response. - Post the debit from our Bank Account the amount will get credited to the customer’s bank account. This is when we get a credit success response. - Once we receive a credit success response we will be posting the disbursal in the ledger and accordingly a Tranche account will be opened. - Based on the disbursal amount, tenure and interest rate the repayment/EMI schedule gets generated. **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Failure):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. There are multiple scenarios once the disbursal/payout request is triggered from our systems: 1. The request is not triggered resulting in an instant failure of the disbursement. In such a case we need to retry initiating the request until it gets triggered to the Payout partner. 2. The request is triggered from our system but due to the Payout partner system being down we get an error resulting in disbursement failure. In such a case we need to re-trigger the request at the same time we receive the error from our payout partner or we can wait for sometime before re-triggering the request. 3. The request is received by the payout partner and the same is acknowledged through a response but the debit from our bank account does not happen and we get a debit failure response. In such a case we need to re-trigger the disbursal request(Depends on tech handling, if we are not able to handle this in V0 then we can mark the disbursal as failure and inform the LSP of the same for them to re-trigger the request and we unblock

- Customer confusion and complaints regarding refund timelines.
- Operational inefficiencies due to manual intervention in refund processing.

## #197 — Term Loan Manual Repayments(VA)
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Customers rely on LSP app or automated mandate flows for repayments. However, some customers may want to make repayments directly to DSP (e.g., via bank transfer). There is no simple mechanism for customers to pay directly outside the LSP ecosystem.

Without a Virtual Account (VA) option:

- Customers lack flexibility in repayment methods.
- Ops team faces reconciliation challenges for direct transfers.

---

**Solution:**

Enable repayments via static Virtual Accounts (VA) mapped per customer. Customers can transfer funds directly to DSP, and the repayment will be posted in the Loan Management System (LMS) with appropriate apportionment, re-amortisation, or foreclosure handling.

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, LSPs do not have visibility into how much of a customer’s pledged portfolio is eligible for unpledging at any given point in time.

When users initiate an unpledge request through the LSP interface, they may encounter errors or rejections if:

- The requested unpledge amount exceeds the eligible limit (based on outstanding loan value, haircut, or margin requirements)

This leads to:

- Poor user experience — users get rejected after attempting unpledge.
- Increased operational load — repeated support queries and failed attempts.
- Inefficient system calls — LSPs m

**Solution:**
?**

We will provide an Eligibility API for Unpledging that LSPs can call before initiating an unpledge request. The API will return aggregate eligibility (amount-wise) for the LSP to inform to their customers on their app. The eligible amount based on which the user will be able to unpledge their funds will be calculated as detailed below:

$Maximum Unpledge Eligible Amount = Drawing Power - Principal Dues - Interest Dues - Outstanding Loan Principal(Not due) -  Outstanding Interest for Upcoming EMI across all Tranches(Not Due) + Total Excess$

If before 90 Days, user reaches out to us to unpledge their collateral instead of going ahead with the loan account creation then Ops will initiate the unpledge on the customer’s request. Customer won’t bear any charge(In V0) for getting their collaterals unpledged. In both the above cases the Ops process remains the same as OD. Ops team will be uploading the collateral unpledge file(Data team will be providing the collateral file to Ops) through the Bulk Upload option on the Command Centre. There won’t be any change in the file type, processing of the bulk upload and further process executions for unpledging of collaterals related to Term Loans. **Post Loan A/C creation:** - Loan Foreclosure: In case user Forecloses the Loan then the unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow same as it is currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. - If customer forecloses all the tranches before the expiry of the Facility/Loan tenure, we won’t initiate the collateral unpledging automatically. - If customer takes the first drawdown and closes/cancels the tranche during the Cool-off period then we won’t be unpledging the collaterals automatically until loan foreclosure or Facility(Loan) tenure expiry. Post Cool-off tranche cancellation three cases arise: 1. Customer proceeds to foreclose the Loan: Unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow as currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. 2. Facility/Loan Tenure expires: This has currently not happened for OD product as well and no process is in place currently. Hence not a part of V0, we can take this up in V2. 3. Customer requests for collateral unpledging from LSP: If there is a Loan level outstanding then the flow is discussed in Partial Unpledging. If there is no Loan level outstanding then the user will be able to select the fund/s they want to unpledge and raise the request for the same(User can raise the unpledging request either in one go or in multiple times). Once the user raises the unpledge request/s through the LSP to DSP it will either go through the STP or nSTP flow, described below. - Partial Unpledging: Customers can only initiate partial

## #204 — How banks and NBFCs manage rounding of interest an
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# How banks and NBFCs manage rounding of interest and charges, and how they handle accounting in these cases. ## **1. Regulatory & Industry Context** ### RBI Guidelines: RBI doesn’t dictate **how to round**, but it **expects fairness, transparency, and precision** in: - Customer charging - Auto-debit recovery - Tax invoicing - Reconciliation of ledgers So, banks and NBFCs need to: - Ensure **customers aren’t overcharged** - Match debits with invoices/statements - Maintain proper **audit trail** and **variance accounting** if rounding is applied --- ## 2. Rounding Methods Used by Banks & NBFCs | Type | Common Use Case | Real-world Examples | | --- | --- | --- | | **No Rounding (Post exact value)** | Charges with GST, floating interest | HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance (on fees), most NBFCs | | **Round to Nearest Rupee** | Interest on EMI loans, penal charges | SBI, ICICI Bank, Fullerton | | **Round Up (Conservative)** | Micro loans, prepaid cards | Some gold loan NBFCs | | **Cumulative Rounding** | Long tenure loans | Used in housing finance | --- ## 3. Detailed Accounting Treatment by Banks/NBFCs ### **A. Exact Posting (No Rounding)** ### Use Case: - Processing fees + GST - Penal charges ### System Flow: 1. Fee computed: ₹100 2. GST @18% = ₹18 3. Total = ₹118.00 (posted and debited as-is) ### Accounting Entries: | Ledger Name | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) | | --- | --- | --- | | Customer Loan Account | ₹118.00 | | | Processing Fee Income | | ₹100.00 | | GST Payable (Output) | | ₹18.00 | ✅ Matches invoice and is tax compliant --- ### **B. Round at Posting (Nearest Rupee)** ### Use Case: - Accrued interest - EMI interest - Installment schedules ### Example: - Accrued Interest: ₹199.48 → Rounded: ₹199 - Accrued Interest: ₹199.50 → Rounded: ₹200 ### System Flow: - Round value **at the point of debit** ### Accounting Entries: | Ledger Name | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹) | | --- | --- | --- | | Customer Loan Account | ₹200.00 | | | Interest Income | | ₹199.48 | | **Rounding Reserve GL (Internal)** | | ₹0.52 | > 🔸 If we round down, the 0.52 may be debited to an expense account. > ### Why Rounding Reserve GL? To track small deltas between system-calculated interest and posted amount. ✅ Fair

# Discussion with Rohan (Groww) 1. Building in-house after 1 year of operations is recommendable instead of building it in-house from the start 2. VideoSDK has good solution for the video session. 3. Groww built all the in-house cause they were aiming for 4. Hyperverge gives a high amount of false negatives 5. Initially: Success rate → 80% and VKYC completion rate → 70% 6. After spending 2 quarters improving on the Vkyc stack, Success rate → 95% and VKYC completion rate → 80% 7. It is important to store the data correctly and in a reproducible manner. 8. IDfy and Digio are recommended VKYC solution providers 9. Digio uses VideoSDK for their video stack - confirmed 10.

# VKYC: Regulatory Understanding - RBI Direction for V-CIP Infrastructure and Procedure [Reserve Bank of India](https://www.rbi.org.in/CommonPerson/english/scripts/notification.aspx?id=2607) Definition of V-CIP (from Section 3): > "Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP)": -CIP an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence by an authorised official of the RE by undertaking seamless, secure, live, informed-consent based audio-visual interaction with the customer to obtain identification information required for CDD purpose, and to ascertain the veracity of the information furnished by the customer through independent verification and maintaining audit trail of the process. Such processes complying with prescribed standards and procedures shall be treated on par with face-to-face CIP for the purpose of this Master Direction." > ### **Risk Classification:** - **High Risk designation** for customers until face-to-face KYC completion within 2 years - **VKYC serves as alternative** to in-person verification for borrowal accounts - **Debit restrictions** apply for high risk customers if KYC is not updated every 2 years ### **Documentation Requirements:** - **E-PAN accepted** - no physical PAN card showcase needed - **Photo matching mandatory** - agent must verify customer photo consistency across Aadhaar/OVD and PAN/e-PAN documents ### **Timeline Compliance:** - **3 working days maximum** from initial identification information collection to VKYC completion - The customer's economic and financial profile/information must be confirmed directly with the customer during the V-CIP process - 3 way check of the face of the customer using the selfie, photo on the OVD/Aadhaar Card and the e-PAN/PAN Card - V-CIP technology infrastructure must be housed on the RE's own premises, with connections and interactions originating only from its secured network. Any outsourced technology must comply with RBI guidelines. For cloud deployments, data ownership must remain solely with the RE, and all data—including video recordings—must be immediately transferred to the RE's owned or leased servers after V-CIP completion. Cloud service providers or third-party technology vendors must not retain any data from the V-CIP process. - ###

What is broken today? - Referrals might happen **informally** but there is no robust mechanism **to track** end to end and motivate existing users to refer more. - There is no system currently to scale the trust factor and brand of Volt being via low-CAC word of mouth viral mechanism. - Business cannot reliably measure **ROI, conversion** on new acquisitions via referral in an organised and systematic manner. - Why is it important? or What is getting impacted? - **High CAC** from paid channels continues to scale. - We miss out on **trust-led growth** from existing users. - Drop-offs in referee journey remain high due to lack of motivation. - Poor operational scalability risks future campaign launches. - Inability to experiment with referral-led growth limits topline impact. --- ## **1.
