## 🟢 LATEST — Multi Drawdown Term Loan LMS Requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 30, 2025 2:56 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

The existing OD-based Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) product does not align with the repayment expectations and financial behavior of a large segment of customers. These users are more familiar with **structured EMI-based repayment formats**, as seen in personal loans, home loans, and auto loans. As a result, product comprehension, drawdown confidence, and repayment discipline are negatively impacted when only an OD line is offered.

This gap is particularly visible in:

- Low drawdown rates from sanctioned limits
- Confusion around usage-based interest calculation
- Hesit

**Solution:**
?

Product Overview

We propose a **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the facility construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown.
- **Enabling multiple drawdowns** from the same facility, with flexibility in amount and tenure.
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.
- **Positioning the product clearly as “term loans with flexibility”**

This hybrid approach is designed to increase adoption, improve credit utilization, and grow customer LTV.

**Product Technical Construct**

A **line-backed, multi-drawdown term loan**, where:

- **Both loan and tranche constructs are exposed to the LSP**.
- DSP manages the **loan** as the credit container; **

## #2 — LOS and LMS admin actions (LSP with DSP as lender)
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 16, 2024 2:25 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

We have developed multiple admin actions (ops controlled actions) that help in servicing our customers in the onboarding as well as the servicing journey. 

This requirement covers utilising the admin actions (where needed) to cover use cases currently served by LSP (for customers) with DSP as a lender.

## #3 — PRD — Term Loan Repayment STP Threshold Update
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** May 29, 2026 5:51 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?

- Current STP repayment thresholds are overly conservative, causing valid low-risk repayments to be unnecessarily routed to NSTP via `REPAYMENT_AMOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (>₹15L) and `REPAYMENT_DAILY_COUNT_EXCEEDED` (>4 repayments/day per LAN).
- Jan–May 2026 production data shows minimal breach risk: only 3 of 1,952 customers (0.15%) made repayments above ₹15L (max observed: ₹20.1L), and no LAN exceeded 5 repayments in a day — indicating the limits can be safely relaxed.
- Unlike other LSPs (Razorpay for Volt, PhonePe dashboard for PhonePe), there is no Cred repayment dashboard a

## #4 — Term Loan LOS requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** May 14, 2026 10:50 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- **Low awareness of line-based lending products:** Most Indian consumers do not understand the concept of a reusable credit line or overdraft (OD)-style borrowing.
- **Poor use of the product as a one-time loan:** Even when users opt in, they typically draw down only once and never return, leading to poor utilization of the approved credit limit.
- **Lack of lifecycle borrowing behavior:** Users do not engage in multiple drawdowns or reborrowing after repayment, resulting in limited customer lifetime value (LTV).
- **Ineffective product positioning:** The existing product f

# Term loan CC enhancements # **Background and Context** - Operations teams currently face multiple visibility and workflow challenges while managing term loans in Command Centre. - Closed tranches automatically disappear from Command Centre once they are closed, resulting in complete loss of visibility for the Ops team for historical tracking and issue resolution. - Excess refund handling for term loans differs from OD loans. Tranche-tagged excess margins are non-refundable, however Command Centre currently does not provide a granular split between refundable and non-refundable excess. This creates inconsistencies between excess refund tasks and the loan details page, making it difficult for Ops teams to follow existing SOPs. - During collateral release approval flows, Ops teams need to validate whether requested DP for un-pledge is within permissible limits `(Unpledge requested DP <= Total DP - TOS)`. Currently, checker tasks do not display TOS or due details, forcing Ops users to manually navigate to loan details pages to retrieve data, leading to delays and increased chances of operational errors. - These gaps impact operational efficiency, increase dependency on manual checks, and create risks of incorrect approvals/refunds. --- # **1.

# credit_bureau_reporting_comms_product_note # Credit Bureau Reporting Communication — Interest Payment Default Notification --- ## **Background and Context** - VoltMoney is a Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) LSP operating on DSP Finance’s NBFC lending infrastructure. As part of its regulatory obligations, DSP Finance is required to report borrowers with outstanding interest dues to credit bureaus within a defined reporting window. - **Who is facing the problem:** - **Borrowers (primary):** Customers with outstanding interest dues on their LAMF accounts are being reported to credit bureaus without receiving any prior or concurrent notification — directly impacting their credit profile without their awareness - **Compliance team (internal):** Responsible for ensuring bureau reporting obligations are met, but currently has no automated comms confirmation to demonstrate borrower notification was completed at time of reporting - **Technology / Engineering team (internal):** No existing trigger or job in place to dispatch comms at the point of bureau reporting; all communication today is manual or absent for this event - **Data Analytics team (internal):** Generates the defaulter list and executes reporting but has no downstream comms handoff mechanism - **What is broken today:** - There is no automated communication workflow that notifies a borrower at the time their interest default is reported to a credit bureau - The current reporting cadence is 2x per month (15th and EOM); from July 1, 2026, this increases to 4x per month (9th, 16th, 23rd, EOM) — increasing the frequency of the compliance gap - The data analytics team generates the defaulted accounts list at 11:59 PM on the reporting date and completes bureau reporting within a 7-day window, but no borrower notification is triggered at the point of reporting - Manual triggering of communications is error-prone and does not scale with increased reporting frequency - **Why it is important / What is getting impacted:** - **Regulatory risk:** RBI’s Fair Practices Code and consumer protection norms require that borrowers be made aware of actions that adversely impact their credit history. Absence of notification creates a direct compliance risk for DSP Finance - **Credit impact transparency:** Borrowers who are unaware of a bureau report have no opportunity to respond, dispute, or clear dues — leading to grievances and regulator escalations - **Scale:** As reporting frequency doubles from July 2026, the gap between reporting events and borrower awareness widens significantly without an automated solution - **Brand trust:** VoltMoney’s positioning as a fair, transparent LAMF LSP

# Product note: LMS integration with Tally ## **Background and Context** - - Who is facing the problem (users, internal teams, partners) - What is the challenge that they are facing? What is broken today? - Why is it important? or What is getting impacted? Most businesses record transactions across multiple ledgers to accurately classify income, expenses, assets, and liabilities arising from each business event such as product sales, and discounts. For us as an NBFC, core business transactions include interest posting, charge application, payouts against sanctioned limits, and customer repayments. Given the regulated nature of lending, NBFC accounting processes are subject to direct regulatory scrutiny by the RBI. It is therefore critical that accounting is accurate, automated, system-driven, and free from manual intervention. Currently, accounting entries are generated in the LMS and then manually transformed and posted into the ERP. This manual handoff introduces operational and control risks. This gap was highlighted as a key vulnerability in our statutory audit and must be addressed as a priority. --- ## **1. Problem scope** ### In scope - - What specific problems are we solving? - Who are we solving it for? Consider both primary and secondary users - **Manual ERP Posting Dependency**: Accounting entries are generated in Finflux (LMS) but are **manually transformed and uploaded into Tally**, creating operational dependency on the Finance team. - **High Risk of Errors and Duplicates**: Manual handling increases the risk of: - Duplicate ledger postings - Incorrect ledger mapping - Debit / credit sign errors - Partial or missed uploads **Lack of Idempotency & Control**: There is currently: - No system enforced idempotency for ERP postings - No way to prevent re-posting of the same transaction - Limited ability to trace an LMS transaction to a Tally voucher **Delayed and Unpredictable TAT**: Posting timelines depend on: - Manual availability of the Finance team - Ad-hoc batch preparation and uploads This leads to **inconsistent turnaround times** **Access control**: Current workflows do not consistently enforce: - System-driven approvals - Clear separation between generation, validation, and posting of accounting entries. ### Out of scope - - Call out on items out of scope - Rationale for exclusion - Manual Reconciliation: Reconciliation between LMS (Finflux) and ERP (Tally) is currently manual and time-intensive, requiring cross-system data pulls and comparisons. This will be picked as an enhancement once the current release is stabilised. ETA to be confirmed - Delayed

## #9 — LAS LMS approach notes
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** February 19, 2026 7:12 PM

# LAS LMS approach notes # Summary: We are planning to launch LAS (Loan Against Securities) for the B2B2C channel, targeting the first 1,000 customers(10 application per day) to measure adoption and define success metrics. For Phase 1, the objective is to enable this launch with minimal changes to the existing product experience. Key considerations: No changes for users who have only a LAMF (Loan Against Mutual Funds) account. No changes in the loan servicing experience for users with only an LAS account. For users holding both LAS and LAMF accounts, we will adopt an “elevate approach” (In elegant way) to effectively manage multiple loan accounts within the same interface. ## LMS service scenarios ### Customer with only LAMF account 1. No change in existing behaviour, flow and configurations ### Customer with only LAS account Expected changes in existing modules | **Modules** | Requirements | Edge cases scenarios | Action items | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Lodgement + Account opening | 1.

## #15 — VA Repayment Handling [Volt LMS]
**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** April 10, 2025 10:50 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, Volt cannot create the Virtual Account (VA) repayment requests, resulting in an inability to track and post repayments made through Virtual Accounts. This creates a gap between DSP Finance's successful repayment processing and Volt's internal payment posting system, leading to potential reconciliation issues and incomplete financial records.

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will implement a webhook integration system that receives repayment notifications from DSP Finance when a customer successfully makes a repayment via their Virtual Account. The system will map the FXLAN (Fenix Loan Account Number) provided in the webhook to our internal creditId, allowing us to properly post and track these repayments in our database.

## #18 — API flow for KFS and Agreement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As a platform, there are multiple ways through which LSPs can integrate with our platform, our current implementation offers a redirection flow for collecting KFS consent and Agreement signatures.

In the redirection flow, the customer’s IP and acknowledgement/ signing timestamps are consumed. However not all LSPs would be comfortable with redirecting the users to a different URL for the following reasons:

- They want to own the customer experience (having a different UI will impact their user journey).
- Redirection URLs often require internal approvals to whitelist domain

**Solution:**
?**

We will be decoupling the existing sequential process of Key Fact Statement (KFS) and Agreement generation by building independent APIs. This will enable Loan Service Providers (LSPs) to:

- Generate KFS and Agreement documents separately.
- Collect KFS acknowledgements and Agreement signatures independently via APIs.

This modular approach enhances flexibility and improves integration capabilities for partner platforms.

Additional changes:

- **Validation Layer:** Implement robust validation mechanisms to ensure that all collected data and process flows remain compliant with regulatory guidelines and internal business rules.
- **Command centre changes:** Implement changes to enable operations team to identify, and accordingly handle different sign methodologies separately

## #19 — Additional details enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

To support underwriting and assess the end use of funds, we currently collect the following additional user details:

- Marital status
- Educational qualification
- Mother's first and last name
- Father's first and last name
- Loan purpose
- Income range
- Employment status

While this information is essential, requiring users to fill seven separate fields has contributed to a noticeable drop-off rate—ranging from **1% to 5% across different LSPs**—which negatively impacts the top of the funnel.

**Solution:**
?**

- V2 API with optional and mandatory fields
    - Mandatory fields:
        - Employment details
        - Income range

## #21 — Approved Scrips productisation
**Status:** Pending review | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
We are solving for:

- A governed, audited maker-checker flow for all approved scrip updates in Command Centre
- Support for the following scrip operations via this flow:
    - **Approve new ISIN** — add a new ISIN (Mutual fund or Share) to the approved scrip with all required parameters
    - **Stop new lodgements** — set min LTV to zero for an ISIN (blocks new pledges without impacting existing 

# Approved Scrips productisation Last Edited: May 8, 2026 12:03 PM PRD ETA: April 21, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context The approved scrip list is the master reference that controls which ISINs can be pledged as collateral in the LMS, and at what LTV. It has two layers: - **Finflux approved scrip** — Global NBFC-level list managed in the LMS (Finflux). Stores min LTV and max LTV per ISIN and enforces that no lodged collateral exceeds max LTV. (Min LTV for default LTV value, Max LTV as a ceiling validation) - Finflux max LTV should be equal to Risk LTV and Finflux min LTV should be equal to Fenix min LTV - **Fenix approved scrip** — Internal list managed at a co-lender relationship (contract) level (colending vs non-colending) and product level (LAS and LAMF). Fenix carries three LTV values per ISIN: Regulatory LTV (= max LTV), Risk LTV (internal ceiling set by the risk team, ≤ Regulatory LTV), and Min LTV. Today, updates to both scrips require manually calling APIs in Fenix and Finflux separately. This is done by anyone with API access and without any audit trail, approval gate, or role-based control. **Who is affected:** - Risk ops team (makers) who need to update scrips frequently but have no safe, governed tool to do so - Risk managers (checkers) who have no visibility into what changed, when, and by whom - End users and LSPs who are indirectly impacted by incorrect LTV values (inflated or deflated offers, wrong shortfall calculations) **What is broken today:** - Fenix and Finflux scrips are updated separately and can fall out of sync — they should be updated atomically - Direct API updates are error-prone. A documented past incident set LTVs to 50 instead of 50% causing 100x limit inflation - No audit log exists for scrip changes — there is no way to trace who changed what and when - No role-based control — anyone with API access can make changes with immediate live impact on offer generation and shortfall computation **Why it matters now — three upcoming catalysts:** 1. **Colending expansion** — More colending relationships mean more contract-level approved scrip variants, increasing change frequency 2. **LTV increase to 70%** — Moving from 45% to 70% introduces higher risk volatility and requires more frequent scrip tuning by the risk team 3. **Loan against Shares launch** — Shares are more

# BRD: Enhancements to Schedule & Derived Details Processing for OD (Loan Against Mutual Funds) Last Edited: December 11, 2025 2:41 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **1. Problem Statement** Our OD product relies heavily on Finflux’s **schedule** and **schedule-derived details** for: - Accurate repayment allocation - DPD computation - Interest/charge tracking - Reconciliation, reporting (internal and external) Currently, certain system behaviours in the LMS lead to **incomplete or incorrect schedule updates**, which introduces reconciliation gaps and incorrect ageing/DPD calculations. We need Finflux to enhance how the LMS **creates, updates, and settles obligations** and **populates derived details** whenever specific transactions occur. --- ## **2. Context: How It Should Work (High Level)** - Any due created on a line (interest, charge, fee, penalty) should create an **obligation** in the schedule. - Currently we do not get the source transaction that created that obligation, we require source transaction to be mapped with the schedule ID so that we can directly map the transactions that created the corresponding schedule - When a transaction settles that obligation, the schedule and derived details should reflect: - obligation met - amount accounted - linkage to the transaction identifier - timestamps for audit - For OD products, interest accrues daily and becomes due only under certain events (billing, foreclosure (clear dues) etc.). Finflux already follows this pattern for regular repayments. The gaps occur only for specific transaction types listed below. --- ## **3. Issues & Required Enhancements** --- ## **3.1 Issue 1: *Clear Dues (used for Foreclosure) does not update schedule or derived details*** ### **Current Behaviour** - During foreclosure, Fenix performs a **“clear dues”** transaction to make the accrued interest due for the line: - Accrued-but-not-yet-due interest is first made due. - Finflux then settles this newly created due using excess funds when the clear dues API is hit - However: - The **schedule table is not updated** to reflect the new temporary obligation. - The **obligation is not marked as met**. - **Derived details** are not populated with the settlement transaction. ### **Impact** - Reporting discrepancies (interest recognised vs. interest settled). - Incorrect DPD because obligations appear “unmet”. ### **Required Behaviour** Finflux should: 1. **Create an obligation** in the schedule whenever clear-dues makes an amount due (accrued interest or any charge). 2. **Immediately settle the obligation** and mark: - obligation_met = true - obligation_met_on = timestamp 3. **Populate derived details** with: - linkage to the

## #23 — BRD Interest Refund via Credit Note - OD - V2
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
- Refund of interest already posted and/or collected
- Refund processed only via Credit Note (Interest type)
- Support for partial and full interest refunds
- Integrated accounting and LMS impact
- Duplicate refund control with necessary dedupe validations

# BRD: Interest Refund via Credit Note - OD - V2 Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Objective Interest is periodically accrued, posted, and collected from users as part of the OD loan lifecycle and recognized as interest income in the accounting system. In certain business scenarios (pricing corrections, excess collection, grievance redressal, operational errors, etc.), a portion of already posted and/or collected interest may need to be refunded to the user. The objective of this document is to define a **system-driven, auditable mechanism** to process interest refunds via Credit Note with correct accounting treatment. The solution must ensure: - Accurate reversal of interest income in P&L - Correct user-level balance adjustment - Elimination of manual accounting interventions - Full audit traceability --- ## 2. Scope ### In Scope - Refund of interest already posted and/or collected - Refund processed only via Credit Note (Interest type) - Support for partial and full interest refunds - Integrated accounting and LMS impact - Duplicate refund control with necessary dedupe validations ### Out of Scope - Interest waiver before posting --- ## 3.

## #27 — Charge reversal enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Today, waiving or refunding charges for a user is manual, operationally intensive, and people-dependent process. Not only does this make it error prone, it introduces friction across internal teams and impacts customer experience. The key issues we’re addressing include:

---

**Solution:**
?**

We will be creating a charge waiver task for command centre which will behave in the following manner:

- If a charge is completely outstanding, that is the amount that was applied has not been collected from the user, will be waived.
- If a charge is completely paid/collected from the user, we will be passing a credit note to the user’s loan account

<aside>
🚨

If a charge is partially paid/collected, we will not allow it to be waived or refunded - (Validation error). - We will now be passing a credit note for this as well

</aside>

- If a charge is partially paid/collected, we will not allow it to be waived or refunded - (Validation error).

We will be creating a new payment type called “CREDIT_NOTE” this repayment will not have a corresponding money transaction associated with it.

## #28 — Charge reversal enhancement V2
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Today, waiving or refunding charges was manual, operationally intensive, and people-dependent. With the charge reversal enhancement now built and deployed, we have eliminated dependency on engineering/backend intervention, reduced friction for internal teams, and improved customer resolution time.

This PRD documents the final implemented solution — including the maker/checker workflow, credit note processing, validations, accounting flows, and the enhancements required to support charges with no GST and the productisation manual JV transaction posting

---

**Solution:**
?**

All components below are **implemented and live**.

We have created a **Charge Refund Maker/Checker workflow** that behaves as follows:

- **If a charge is completely outstanding** → it is waived.
- **If a charge is completely collected/paid** → a **Credit note** is issued to the loan account.
- **If a charge is partially collected** → a **Credit note** is issued to the loan account.

A new repayment type **“Credit note”** is now supported in LMS.

This repayment *does not* trigger any cash movement. Operations uses this type for reconciliation visibility.

The first set of supported use cases now live:

- Processing fees
- Margin pledge charges
- Dishonour fees
    
    (All as configured under ADHOC charges)

**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Corporate action - Data feed Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # Corporate Actions Data Feed ## Overview To support monitoring of securities pledged as collateral, we have reviewed a **Corporate Actions data feed sourced from BSE end-of-day bulletins**. This feed provides information on **events and disclosures that may impact the value, structure, or tradability of securities**. The data is consumed daily and can be used by the Risk team to monitor portfolio changes and identify events that may require action. The data covers the following broad categories: - Corporate action events - Company structural changes - Market disclosures - Large market transactions - Insider activity - Liquidity indicators --- # 1. Corporate Action Events This dataset contains information about **corporate actions declared by listed companies** that may affect the number of shares, price, or entitlement of shareholders. Typical corporate actions include: - Dividends - Stock splits - Bonus issues - Rights issues - Buybacks - Capital restructuring events For each event, the feed provides key reference dates such as: - **Record Date** – Date used to determine shareholder eligibility - **Ex-Date** – Date after which the security trades without the entitlement - **Cum Date** – Date before which investors must hold shares to be eligible - **Effective Dates** – Time period during which the action is applicable In addition, where applicable, the feed also provides: - Dividend amount or payout value - Share conversion ratios (e.g., split or bonus ratios) - Share quantity adjustments - Offer price or premium for rights issues These events are critical for adjusting **collateral valuation and share quantities** in pledged portfolios. --- # 2. Corporate Action Classification A separate master dataset provides the **mapping of corporate action identifiers to the specific event type** (e.g., dividend, split, bonus). This allows systems to interpret the corporate action feed and determine the **nature of the event impacting a security.** ---

## #33 — DSP Consent Architecture (Oct25)
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

DSP currently captures consents as 2-3 line items. This is mostly restricted to email and mobile verification. None of the other consents in the journey are recorded in our DB from an audit trail perspective.

As per DPDP act, REs need to capture consent for data that’s absolutely required and more importantly store and mange it in a structured manner. This would require DSP to revoke consents if not applicable or not required as per policy. This would require DSP to maintain a strong audit trail for each consent in the journey.

# Disbursement simulation - LMS Last Edited: May 22, 2026 3:49 PM PRD ETA: May 5, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context - **Who is affected** - Borrowers using Volt (DSP Finance's LSP) who initiate withdrawal requests from their Loan Against Mutual Fund (LAMF) accounts. - All LSP partners integrated with DSP Finance's disbursement infrastructure. - DSP Finance's Risk Operations team, who are exposed to collateral shortfall risk when disbursements breach the safe limit. - **What is broken today** - The current Available Limit calculation — `AL = min(DP, SL) - POS + EM` does not account for accrued interest, charges, or scenarios where non-principal exposure grows to exceed the margin held against collateral. Two specific scenarios expose DSP Finance to risk: - **Case 1 — Collateral Removal:** After a borrower repays principal and requests maximum collateral removal, the remaining collateral may only cover the Drawing Power. Any subsequent withdrawal creates a situation where accrued interest (once booked as Interest Due) pushes total exposure above collateral value. - **Case 2 — Voluntary Sell-off:** After a sell-off settles principal, the sell-off proceeds inflate Excess Money, which inflates the Available Limit. A borrower can withdraw this excess, creating a POS that, combined with accrued interest becoming due, exceeds the remaining collateral value. - Today, the Loan Detail API value is trusted by all downstream systems (Fenix, Volt, and LSP partners) as the authoritative available limit. There is no pre-disbursement validation layer that applies the updated risk-safe AL formula before funds are transferred. - **Why it matters** - Collateral shortfall represents direct credit risk for DSP Finance — in cases of default, outstanding dues cannot be fully recovered. - The gap grows over time as accrued interest compounds, making early intervention critical. - LSP partners rely on the available limit shown to borrowers; without a simulation gate, disbursements that breach exposure limits will be processed without any check. --- ## 1. Problem Scope ### In scope - Building a new Disbursement Simulation API that computes the risk-safe maximum withdrawal amount using the updated AL formula. - Updating the Volt (LSP) frontend to call the Disbursement Simulation API between the 'Enter Withdrawal Amount' screen and the 'Confirm Amount' screen. - Graceful borrower communication on Volt when the entered amount exceeds the simulation limit — showing the maximum allowed amount and enabling re-entry. - API design contract documentation to be shared with

## #35 — Dishonour charge enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Dishonour charges are applied to user loan accounts when monthly dues are not paid before the 7th of the month. However, the current application is tied to the outcome of mandate presentation, which results in inconsistent charge application across accounts.

**Problems Identified**

1. **Missed Charges Due to No Mandate:**
    
    Dishonour charges are **not applied** to users who do not have an active mandate (e.g., revoked mandates), even if they miss their due date.
    
2. **Incorrect Charges Despite Repayment:**
    
    Users who have already paid their dues manually

**Solution:**
?**

To make the application of dishonour charges **independent of the mandate presentation process** by introducing a post-due date review mechanism that ensures charges are applied fairly and consistently based on actual repayment behaviour.d

<aside>
⚠️

In case mandate is revoked or does not exist, if the collection amount is less than 10 Rs, it should be waived

## #37 — FD Fixerra
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# FD: Fixerra Last Edited: December 1, 2025 2:13 PM ### Product Alignment Note – Fixerra FD Offering via Partner Dashboard *(DSP Finance × Volt Platform)* --- ### **Problem statement** Volt x DSP have a strong distribution via IFAs, we want to experiment distribution of different products via this channel, because of DSP Finance (NBFC) is looking to expand its retail investment footprint beyond LAMF (Loan Against Mutual Funds) by introducing a Fixed Deposit (FD) product. On the Volt platform today, distributors (primarily MFDs) only have LAMF as the monetizable product. While LAMF has strong unit economics, it is not a top-of-funnel product for retail customers. Fixerra provides the underlying FD product and infrastructure. The hypothesis is: - We already have arms-reach access to a large base of customers with mutual fund holdings. - These customers have a natural affinity for low-risk investment instruments. - FDs can act as a trust-building, widely accepted entry product, opening the funnel for both direct revenue (FD) and future LAMF conversions. This note outlines the scope for v1 of FD origination and servicing through the Volt Partner Dashboard, and is intended to align stakeholders across DSP Finance, Volt, and Fixerra. --- ### 2. Problem statement ### 2.1 Current state - MFDs on Volt can only offer LAMF. - Monetization is limited to one product with a relatively narrow target audience. - No simple “safe” product exists to attract or engage a wider customer base. - Distributors lack tools to deepen customer relationships beyond MF transactions. ### 2.2 Opportunity Introducing FDs: - Expands the product portfolio for MFDs. - Helps create a trust-led entry point (“mouth of the funnel”), improving conversions into higher-ticket products like LAMF. - Offers DSP Finance a scalable retail deposit base. - Allows Fixerra to distribute its FD product through MFD networks. --- ### 3. Product hypothesis **FDs can become a high-trust, low-friction product that increases distributor engagement and revenue, while simultaneously opening the pipeline for LAMF upsell.** Supporting hypotheses: 1. Customers with MF holdings are more likely to evaluate FD products with high confidence. 2. MFDs will be able to deepen their relationship and improve overall earnings by offering a broader product suite. 3. The NBFC can explore differentiated FD structuring based on distribution performance (for example, special rates, bulk programs). --- ### 4. High-level GTM - **Channel:** Volt Partner Dashboard - **Actors:** Mutual Fund Distributors on Volt - **v1

**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Finflux Product Setup for Co-Lending Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: January 27, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Context As part of the co-lending setup, loans are economically split between: - **10% exposure (CLA portion)** - **90% exposure (TCL)** - **100% loan representation** required for operational and accounting purposes Current state: - Finflux is running on a **single instance** supporting **OD and TL products** - All reporting, accounting, SMA/NPA tagging, and operational workflows are currently **instance-scoped** - Finflux manages collateral and exposure deduplication The setup needs to support: - Fast go-live - Clean accounting - Correct delinquency signaling to TCL - Minimal disruption to existing production flows --- ## 2. Problem Statement The co-lending structure introduces multiple complexities: - **Collateral deduplication risk** if multiple loans referencing the same securities exist in the same instance - **Client-level SMA/NPA contagion**, where delinquency in a small CLA exposure may impact unrelated production loans - **Accounting segregation** required across different exposure types - **Operational overhead** introduced by multiple Finflux instances - **Reporting and reconciliation complexity** across LMS, Finflux, and TCL --- ## 3. Design Options Considered ### Option A: Single Finflux Instance with Multiple Products - All co-lending loans (10% and 100%) reside in the same instance - Separation handled purely via product-level configurations **Challenges** - High risk of collateral dedupe conflicts - Client-level NPA impact across all loans - Heavy reliance on product-level filters across reporting and accounting - Higher regression risk for existing OD and TL products --- ### Option B: Multiple Finflux Instances for All Co-Lending Loans - Separate instances for 10% and 100% loans **Challenges** - Higher setup and maintenance effort - Configuration and version-sync risks - Increased reporting and reconciliation overhead - Multiple operational points of failure at launch --- ## 4. Final Recommendation (Chosen Approach) **Recommended Setup** - **10% co-lending loan (CLA exposure)** → Booked in the **existing Finflux instance** - **100% loan** → Booked in a **separate Finflux instance** - **90% exposure** → Booked in **TCL** This approach optimizes for **lower effort, faster go-live, and controlled risk**, while keeping core production flows isolated. --- ## 5. Rationale for the Recommendation ### 5.1 Faster Go-Live with Minimal Change Surface - Existing Finflux instance already supports: - Live products - Accounting - Reporting - Monitoring - Adding a **single CLA product (10%)** is significantly lower effort than: - Standing up and

Every day, over 200 customers apply for a loan. For 1–3 of these customers, the IFSC is missing in Finflux, our core lending platform. Currently, adding a missing IFSC requires raising a support ticket to the Finflux team, which takes 3–4 working hours.

This manual dependency directly delays account opening, increases operational overhead, and negatively affects the customer experience and turnaround time (TAT).

When securities are lien marked in favour of DSP Finance, it also gives the capability to the NBFC to invoke the lien to redeem the securities, this gives the proceeds from the sale of securities to the NBFC which is posted in the security holder’s loan account.

The following reasons are why there is a need for this capability:

- If the user goes into a shortfall, and is unable to regularise (DP>POS) their loan account within a stipulated time period (7 working days as defined by RBI), the NBFC is required to invoke securities to regularise the account

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

There is no dedicated system to centrally manage the lifecycle of collateral for Loan Against Securities (LAS).

This leads to operational risk, poor scalability, and delayed exception handling.

**Status:** Done | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

In a Loan Against Securities (LAS) setup, collateral positions are dynamic — securities can be lien marked, revoked, confiscated, or impacted by corporate actions at any time. For the NBFC, accurate and timely tracking of these changes is critical to:

- **Maintain exposure** by ensuring only lien-marked securities are considered as collateral.
- **Protect against credit and operational risk** by reconciling collateral transactions with actual depository data.

Why is it important?

- **Detection of lien mismatches** (e.g., securities released or confiscated without a reques

**Solution:**
?**

We will integrate **Pledge Master Report (PMR) consumption** into the Collateral Management System (CMS) to create a single, authoritative repository of all securities lien-marked in favour of the NBFC.

The PMR, received periodically from the depository, will be ingested into CMS and transformed into a structured collateral database. This will allow:

- **Automated lien verification** against depository records.
- **Accurate reconciliation** of pledged holdings between NBFC and depository data.
- **End-to-end collateral transaction lifecycle management** — tracking lien marking, revocation, substitution, and invocation.
- **NBFC-specific pledged collateral tracking** to maintain exposure accuracy.
- **Unlinked collateral identification and resolution** for pending customer applicatio

## #47 — LAS Collateral management system
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

# LAS: Collateral management system Last Edited: July 28, 2025 8:43 PM PRD ETA: June 27, 2025 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **What is CMS?** The Collateral Management System (CMS) will act as the central infrastructure for managing pledged shares for a Loan Against Shares (LAS) product. It will interface with the Loan Origination System (LOS), Loan Management System (LMS), and Depository Participant (DP) — SHCIL — to manage the full lifecycle of collateral from validation to lien marking, valuation, revocation, and reconciliation. It will also include risk management via real-time LTV monitoring, handling of corporate actions, and tools for operations teams. [CMS system architecture](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b5a68c3c-4705-4c9d-b34b-52a1d6bb8ec4) --- # Why do we need a CMS? A **Collateral Management System (CMS)** is essential for a **Loan Against Shares (LAS)** product because collateral (in the form of pledged shares) is **the core security** backing the loan. Without an automated, secure, and integrated system to manage this collateral, the business is exposed to **operational risk, financial risk, and regulatory gaps**. 1. Centralised tracking and management of collaterals: Currently all collaterals are managed by the LMS which makes it very risk prone: A CMS ensures each step is trackable, audit-logged, and consistent with external systems (DP/SHCIL) and internal ones (LMS/LOS). 2. CMS constantly monitors Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios. If share prices fall, LTV breaches can be automatically flagged (exposure tracking), triggering margin calls or partial lien revocation. 3. Logic separation from LMS: CMS has a lot of collateral management intelligence which should be LMS agnostic, this will make our LMS very modular and easily replaceable since majority of the complexity of collateral management will be handled via CMS. --- # **How are others solving this problem?** The approach to collateral management for Loan Against Shares (LAS) varies widely across the lending ecosystem, largely depending on a company’s scale, tech maturity, and risk appetite. Broadly, solutions fall into two categories: ### 1. **Tightly Coupled CMS-LMS Systems (Usually Vendor-Provided)** Some lenders use **end-to-end lending platforms** where the CMS is embedded within the LMS — often provided by a third-party vendor. These platforms offer: - Pre-integrated lien workflows - Basic LTV tracking - Unified borrower and collateral view ### 2. **No CMS — Operations-Led Collateral Tracking** Most early-stage or mid-sized lenders operate without a dedicated CMS. Instead, they rely on: - Manual **ops processes** to initiate and track lien/revocation files - **Excel sheets or shared dashboards** to monitor pledged ISINs

# LAS LMS Product Note Last Edited: March 16, 2026 4:03 PM PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **Concept Journey Note: Blended Loan Against Shares & Mutual Funds** --- ### **Overview** This document outlines the transaction and servicing lifecycle for the **blended LAS-LAMF product**. While loan origination and management remain unified, **collateral management bifurcates at the asset level** (Shares vs Mutual Funds). Key principles: - A **combined DP account** is maintained per customer, but **collateral operations are asset-specific**. - **RMS (Risk Management System)** provides real-time valuation (15-min intervals), while **LMS (Loan Management System)** runs off daily NAVs or EOD market prices. - All DP negative impact money and collateral transactions are **double-validated by LMS + RMS** to ensure real-time coverage, DP sufficiency. --- ## **1. MONEY TRANSACTIONS** --- ### **1.1 Disbursement (Forward + Reverse)** - **Forward Disbursement:** - Triggered post approval and sufficient DP validation (LMS) - RMS validates real-time prices (every 15 minutes). - LMS validates EOD price consistency - Both systems must independently confirm DP sufficiency. - On success: disbursement request is sent to TSP; loan status updated. (Cashfree) - **Reverse Disbursement:** - Used in cases of failed payout - Transaction reversed, collateral DP recalculated. --- ### **1.2 Repayment (Forward + Reverse)** - **Forward Repayment:** - Triggered via user mandate or manual repayment (UPI/netbanking/DC/VA) - LMS receives repayment; validates against due and excess amounts. - **Reverse Repayment:** - Applicable when repayment fails due to banking errors or incorrect credit. - LMS adjusts ledger and reverses credit. --- ### **1.3 Excess Refund** - LMS calculates overpayment (e.g., duplicate repayment, excess interest). - Refund is initiated after checking **updated DP position** via (RMS + LMS) - Final payout initiated via TSP only when RMS confirms buffer post-refund. --- ### **1.4 Charge Application (Forward + Waiver + Refund)** - **Forward:** - Charges (processing, penal charge, Dishonour fees) posted via LMS on configured triggers. - **Waiver:** - Ops-triggered waiver requests. - **Refund:** - Charge reversed, and refund processed. (Credit note) --- ## **2. SERVICING** --- ### **2.1 Closure** - Triggered after full repayment and complete collateral release. - LMS validates: - Zero principal (LMS) - No pending charges (LMS) - No open collateral pledges (CMS) - Closure confirmation sent to DP, TSP, and customer. --- ### **2.2 Renewal** - Applicable for LAMF/LAS products with fixed-term limits. - At maturity, a renewal window opens. --- ### **2.3 Mobile / Email / Bank Account Update

# LMS: Multiple sell off requests Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: January 16, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## 1. Background & Context In the current LAS / LAMF sell-off flow, the system allows **only one non-terminal sell-off request per loan** at any point in time. Operationally, this breaks in real-world scenarios where: - Sell-off is raised across **multiple funds** and one or more invocations **fail partially** at the RTA / AMC level - Failed invocations do not cover the **entire overdue or shortfall** - Ops is forced to raise **another sell-off request** while the earlier one is still in progress or stuck (Which is currently blocked by a validation that only one non terminal request is allowed). This leads to: - Manual workarounds by the engineering team to support the use case - Delays in curing shortfall / overdue - Risk of exposure breach if sell-off cannot be retriggered in time - Risk of incorrect updates by the engineering team --- ## 2. Problem Statement **Ops raises a sell-off request for multiple securities.** - Some invocations succeed - One or more invocations fail or get stuck (e.g. CAMS / KFIN issues) - Proceeds received are **insufficient to cover the shortfall** - System blocks Ops from raising another sell-off request due to an existing non-terminal request This creates a deadlock where: - Exposure remains unresolved - Ops cannot act despite legitimate need - Manual intervention becomes necessary --- ## 3. Current Sell-Off Flow (As-Is) 1. **Sell-off Initiation** - Ops raises sell-off via **Bulk Maker** at **collateral level** - Requests are consolidated at **loan level** - A single sell-off request is created per loan 2. **Blocking Logic** - Selected units are blocked in LMS - Blocked units stop contributing to **Drawing Power (DP)** 3. **Threshold Calculation** ``` AvailableThreshold= DP - POS - COS - IOS - Accrued Interest ``` - Blocking ensures: - No excess collateral release - No further disbursement beyond safe exposure 4. **Invocation Flow** - RTA APIs (CAMS / KFIN) invoked - RTAs pass requests to AMCs - AMC sells securities 5. **Settlement & Reconciliation** - Proceeds credited to NBFC bank account - Settlement TAT: 2–3 working days - Ops reconciles proceeds via bulk operation - Proceeds mapped to collateral sell-off requests - Amount posted to respective loan accounts in LMS --- ## 4. Key Issue in Current Design - System enforces **single non-terminal

## #50 — LSP Presentation enhancement for externally regist
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, all mandate registrations for DSP Finance are done internally through our TSP (Digio) integration. As we onboard LSP partners like Smallcase, there is a need for them to independently initiate mandate registration flows while still maintaining DSP Finance’s sponsor bank credentials.

This enhancement allows Smallcase to register mandates on behalf of DSP Finance, improving the customer experience by reducing redirects and enabling a native flow within the LSP app.

However, since mandates will be registered from the partner’s Digio account, DSP will not have direc

**Solution:**
?**

We will extend mandate registration capability to Smallcase via Digio by sharing DSP’s sponsor bank configuration. Smallcase will have restricted access — limited only to mandate registration (not cancellation or presentation).

Post successful registration, Smallcase will call submitMandateDetails API to push the mandate details to DSP for internal record-keeping and tagging.

During future mandate presentations, if the mandate is tagged as external, DSP will additionally pass bank_account and ifsc in the presentation request since these details are unavailable within DSP’s Digio account context.

## #51 — Loan cancellation - No cost EMI TL (Cred)
**Status:** Pending review | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Loan cancellation - No cost EMI / TL (Cred) Last Edited: May 26, 2026 9:08 PM PRD ETA: May 26, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora --- ## Background and context ### Who is facing the problem - Borrowers who have taken a No Cost EMI loan against a merchant purchase and subsequently return the product or drop off mid-journey. - Borrowers who have an Insurance Premium Financing (IPF) loan where the insurance policy is cancelled either by the insurer or by the borrower. - CRED TL customers who have taken a loan and want to cancel within the loan cancellation period. - Ops and collections teams who currently have no automated lifecycle event for cancellation, distinct from foreclosure. - Risk teams who need cancelled loans excluded from bureau reporting which requires a distinct CANCELLED status, not CLOSED. ### What is broken today - There is no cancellation event in the current loan lifecycle. Cancellation and foreclosure are conflated, which creates incorrect P&L treatment, incorrect bureau reporting, and incorrect charge recovery. - When a merchant initiates a product return, there is no clean mechanism to unwind the loan, waive obligations, and return collected funds to the borrower. - Excess parking at line level does not work for cancelled tranches because excess needs to be tagged to the specific cancelled tranche for the refund to be correctly attributed. ### Why it matters - **Bureau reporting:** loans cancelled due to product return or policy cancellation must not be reported to credit bureaus. This requires a distinct CANCELLED status that bureau reporting logic can filter on. - **P&L accuracy:** interest waiver on cancellation must be treated as an income reversal, not a write-off. Without a proper cancellation flow, P&L entries are incorrect. - **Customer experience:** borrowers who return products or cancel policies are entitled to a refund of collected amounts. Without this flow, refunds are manual and error-prone. --- ## 1. Problem scope | In scope | Out of scope | | --- | --- | | No Cost EMI (NCEMI) term loan tranche cancellation | Foreclosure (separate flow — live) | | Insurance Premium Financing (IPF) loan cancellation | Partial cancellation | | All four obligation state scenarios (see Section 3) | Borrower-unilateral cancellation (enforced at Fenix layer) | | Configurable cancellation window (beyond 14 days) | Merchant settlement and MMS integration (Fenix layer) | | Obligation-level configurability for waiver and refund

Today, Pledge Master Reports (PMRs) are received over email at [collaterals@dspfin.com](mailto:collaterals@dspfin.com). The ops team shares these with engineering, who manually hit an API to consume the report - creating an operational bottleneck that directly impacts loan account opening timelines for the Loan Against Shares (LAS) program.

## #55 — PPSL UPI mandate presentation

**In scope:**
The scope of this enhancement includes:

- Supporting UPI mandate registration through PPSL for PayTM-originated users
- Enhancing LOS mandate registration APIs to support explicit provider tagging

- Persisting provider information within LOS
- LMS consuming provider metadata from LOS
- LMS routing mandate presentation based on provider
- Suppo

# PPSL UPI mandate presentation Last Edited: May 25, 2026 10:00 PM PRD ETA: May 25, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **Background and Context** PayTM currently uses the existing DSP Finance (Fenix) mandate registration and presentation stack for both NACH and UPI mandates, where mandate registration is facilitated via Digio and mandate presentation is managed through DSP Finance workflows. PayTM intends to migrate mandate registration for a subset of users to the internal PPSL mandate stack. The primary motivation behind this change is to significantly improve the end-user registration experience by enabling native invocation of the UPI intent flow directly through the PayTM ecosystem. This removes dependency on external redirection-heavy flows and improves TPAP handoff reliability during mandate registration. Historically, the PPSL UPI mandate presentation workflow differed from the existing Digio-integrated flow: - Digio workflow: - Single consolidated API call - Automatically registers PDN and presents mandate together - Mandatory condition that mandate presentation occurs more than 24 hours in the future - PPSL workflow (earlier implementation): - PDN scheduling and mandate presentation were independent APIs/workflows - Required additional orchestration effort from LMS/LOS PPSL has now aligned its APIs and shared updated documentation enabling the required orchestration compatibility. However, this introduces an operational and technical challenge: - Certain PayTM customers will continue using Digio mandates - New customers may register mandates using PPSL - LMS presentation logic must identify which mandate provider was used during registration to correctly invoke downstream presentation workflows Currently, LOS internally maintains provider mapping through a provider column, however the external mandate registration APIs used by LSPs do not allow explicit provider selection. This creates ambiguity for LMS while determining presentation routing. To solve this, the mandate registration APIs will be enhanced to allow PayTM to explicitly pass the mandate provider during registration. --- # **1. Problem Scope** ## In Scope The scope of this enhancement includes: - Supporting UPI mandate registration through PPSL for PayTM-originated users - Enhancing LOS mandate registration APIs to support explicit provider tagging - Allowing PayTM to explicitly pass `provider = PPSL` - Persisting provider information within LOS - LMS consuming provider metadata from LOS - LMS routing mandate presentation based on provider - Supporting coexistence of: - Legacy Digio mandates - PPSL mandates - Maintaining the existing UPI mandate presentation logic at LMS layer: - Loan account level presentation creation - Collection batch item generation - Existing downstream presentation

# Part payments - No cost EMI / TL (Cred) Last Edited: May 22, 2026 11:34 AM PRD ETA: May 22, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and context ### Who is facing the problem - Borrowers with active TL tranches under a credit line who wish to reduce their repayment burden, improve collateral coverage, or avoid forced liquidation of pledged securities. - Collections teams who need a structured tool to help distressed borrowers reduce delinquency probability without full foreclosure. - Risk and ops teams who currently have no automated principal-reduction pathway and handle these requests manually. ### What is broken today - Borrowers have no self-serve mechanism to make a partial principal repayment against a tranche. - The only options available are full EMI payment, excess parking at line level, or full foreclosure — none of which address the mid-path use case of reducing outstanding principal while keeping the tranche live. - Excess parking, while improving the shortfall formula on paper, does not reduce tranche-level obligations. Borrowers who park excess as a shortfall cure remain exposed to re-triggering if security values drop further. - Collections teams have no product-supported tool to recommend structured partial paydowns as part of a repayment sustainability plan. ### Why it matters - Forced liquidation of pledged securities is a high-friction, high-cost event for both borrower and lender. A structured part payment pathway can prevent this. - Borrowers with temporary liquidity (bonus, redemption, salary inflow) have no way to deploy it productively against their loan exposure. - Without this, borrowers approaching shortfall thresholds have only two outcomes: excess parking (fragile cure) or sell-off. Part payment creates a third, durable path. --- ## 1.

Every day, over 200 customers apply for a loan. For 4–5 of these customers, the pincode is missing in Finflux, our core lending platform. Currently, adding a missing pincode requires raising a support ticket to the Finflux team, which takes 3–4 working hours.

This manual dependency directly delays account opening, increases operational overhead, and negatively affects the customer experience and turnaround time (TAT).

This enhancement addresses the following problems.

# Product Note: Penalty migration to Fenix (Colending) Last Edited: April 14, 2026 4:02 PM PRD ETA: March 15, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **Background and Context** Currently, penal charges for overdue loan accounts are computed by an **automated job in Finflux**. This job runs daily at 4 AM and applies penalties when interest becomes overdue. These charges are stored as **applicable charges in Finflux** and surfaced to downstream systems primarily through foreclosure simulations. This architecture introduces several operational and product limitations. **Who is impacted** - Operations teams - Product and engineering teams - Finance and customer support teams - Borrowers indirectly (through slower issue resolution) **Challenges in the current setup** 1. **Limited product control** Penal charge computation logic currently resides inside Finflux jobs. Any change to the logic requires dependency on Finflux configuration and third party coordination. 2. **Limited configurability** The current implementation applies a **flat penalty of ₹10 per day**, whereas the Key Fact Statement (KFS) requires **slab-based penalty computation based on overdue amount**. (This is a compliance observation) 3. **No operational control** Since penalties are not created as **transactions inside Fenix (internal LMS)**: - Operations cannot **waive or refund penalties directly** - Charge-level audit and tracking are difficult 4. **Colending complexity** In Loan-90 / Loan-10 structures, penalties must be **orchestrated across loan legs**. The Finflux-driven penalty logic does not provide sufficient control to ensure accurate charge allocation across colending loans. 5. **Foreclosure simulation dependency** Foreclosure calculations rely on Finflux charge simulations. This makes enhancements difficult and increases dependency on an external system for a critical borrower-facing calculation (Finflux). Additionally, the current system lacks a **generalised framework for defining and applying loan charges**. Future charges such as **Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC)** or other contingent fees would require ad-hoc implementations. This enhancement addresses these limitations by: - Migrating **penal charge computation to Fenix** - Introducing a **generic Applicable Charges framework** - Enabling **charge-level operational controls** - Supporting **future charge types such as AMC** --- # **1. Problem Scope** ## **In Scope** This enhancement addresses the following problems. ### **Migration of penalty computation to Fenix** Daily penal charge computation will move from **Finflux jobs to Fenix**, eliminating system dependency and enabling full product control. ### **Penalty pricing enhancement** Penalty logic will be enhanced from **flat charges to slab-based pricing**, as defined in the KFS. ### **Minimum overdue threshold** Penalties will only be applied when: Overdue Amount ≥ ₹10 This

# Product note: Foreclosure (Colending) Last Edited: May 19, 2026 2:47 PM PRD ETA: March 15, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # **Background and Context** Foreclosure is the process by which a borrower closes the loan account by repaying all outstanding dues including principal, interest, and applicable charges. In the current system architecture, loans are represented internally as **Loan 100**, while in a **colending setup** the exposure is split across: - **Loan 90 (NBFC exposure)** - **Loan 10 (Partner/Lender exposure)** Although Loan 100 represents the borrower-facing account, the underlying accounting and settlement obligations exist across **Loan 90 and Loan 10 in the Colending Loan Management System (CLMS)**. ### Who is impacted - Borrowers initiating foreclosure - Lending partners (colending participants) - Operations teams processing closures - Product and engineering teams responsible for transaction sequencing - Finance teams responsible for settlement and accounting ### What is broken today Foreclosure today largely operates based on **Loan 100 balances**, while the actual liabilities exist across **Loan 90 and Loan 10**. This creates several limitations: 1. **Incorrect foreclosure simulation** Foreclosure amounts may be computed using only Loan 100 data without validating Loan 90 and Loan 10 balances. 2. **Pending transaction inconsistencies** Foreclosure may be initiated even when **pending transactions exist in CLMS**, leading to inaccurate payoff calculations. 3. **Transaction sequencing issues** Loan closure and collateral release may occur without ensuring that: - Loan 90 and Loan 10 are closed - All charges and interest are posted - Excess settlement is completed 4. **Penalty and applicable charge dependency** Applicable charges (such as penal charges) may be applied after repayment due to **daily charge jobs**, which may cause foreclosure attempts to fail if charges are posted after repayment. 5. **Incorrect collateral release timing** Securities may be released before confirming that **both loan legs are closed**, which introduces risk. ### Why this is important Foreclosure is a **regulatory and customer-sensitive workflow**. Incorrect sequencing may lead to: - Incorrect payoff amounts shared with borrowers - Operational rework due to partial closures - Accounting mismatches across loan legs - Risk of releasing collateral before loan closure creating financial exposure for the NBFC This PRD defines a **colending foreclosure workflow** that ensures: - Correct payoff simulation - Transaction sequencing across loan legs - Controlled collateral release - Accurate excess settlement. --- # **1.

# Product note: Interest rate change handling Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:51 PM PRD ETA: March 19, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## **Background and Context** In the current co-lending construct between DSP (NBFC) and TCL (co-lender), loans are originated and managed across multiple representations within the LMS: - **Loan 90 (TCL Book):** Represents TCL’s capital contribution and is controlled externally by TCL, including interest rate decisions. - **Loan 10 (DSP Book):** Represents DSP’s capital contribution and follows DSP’s internal benchmark and pricing logic. - **Loan 100 (Customer-facing Loan):** A composite loan created in the LMS, reflecting the borrower’s obligation and used for repayment schedules, accruals, and customer communication. The effective interest rate for the borrower is derived as a **weighted average of the underlying lender rates based on capital contribution**: - 90% → TCL (Loan 90) - 10% → DSP (Loan 10) However, from a system and implementation perspective: - The LMS treats **Loan 100 as an independent loan** with its own benchmark and ROI. - Interest rates are currently configured using **benchmark + spread constructs defined at an organizational level**. - There is **no native support for dynamic weighted rate computation** across multiple lender loans within the LMS. --- ### **Problem Statement** As part of ongoing co-lending operations: 1. **Independent Rate Changes by Lenders** - TCL may revise its interest rates (benchmark or spread) independently. - DSP may also revise its own benchmark rates. - These changes directly impact the **effective blended ROI** applicable to the borrower. 2. **Lack of Native Synchronization** - Since Loan 90, Loan 10, and Loan 100 are maintained separately: - Rate changes in Loan 90 (TCL) do not automatically reflect in Loan 100. - Loan 100 must be **manually or systematically updated** to maintain parity with the blended rate. 3. **Risk of Misalignment** - If Loan 90 and Loan 100 are not updated in sync: - Incorrect borrower interest may be charged. - Accruals and repayment splits between lenders may become inconsistent. - Downstream systems (accounting, reconciliation, reporting) may break. 4. **Operational Complexity** - Current benchmark configuration is **organization-wide**, not contract-specific. - With multiple co-lending partners, each having: - Different benchmarks - Different spreads - Different rate change cycles → A single benchmark approach does not scale. --- ### **Constraints** - Loan 100 **must exist as a physical loan in the LMS** and cannot be treated as a derived construct. - LMS

## #71 — Risk management system LAS
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

For loans against collateral with dynamically priced assets like:

- Shares
- Mutual funds

It becomes important to ensure that all transactions and exposure given out to user against loans committed by the NBFC, are validated. As of now only the LMS was responsible for doing these validations, but as our systems and products get more complex, there is an additional need for a separate system with logic separation to validate all transactions.

Traditionally, validation of disbursals, top-ups, sell-offs, or withdrawals was handled solely within the LMS (Loan Management Syste

**Solution:**
?**

The RMS module performs the following responsibilities:

- Ingest and store market data for all pledged securities every 15 minutes.
- Compute real-time LTV (Loan-to-Value) and exposure metrics using pledged quantity and live prices.
- Raise alerts for LTV or exposure breaches.
- Raise alerts to customers on exposure breaches
- Validate user transactions that may impact risk thresholds—like disbursals, release requests, or sell-offs—against real-time metrics before allowing execution.

## #72 — Shortfall Enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
We are solving for six interconnected problems across the shortfall calculation engine:

**A. Fair ageing treatment and correct Exposure definition**
Decompose incremental shortfall into ΔDP and ΔExposure components. Apply ΔExposure recovery independently (FIFO) before any ΔDP worsening creates a new shortfall instance. Exposure throughout the system = POS + Interest Overdue.

**B. Daily shortfall

# Shortfall Enhancement Last Edited: May 6, 2026 2:55 PM PRD ETA: April 23, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) and Loan Against Shares (LAS) are secured credit products where customers pledge securities as collateral. The Drawing Power (DP) — the maximum permissible loan amount — is a function of the market value of the pledged collateral after applying the applicable LTV. A shortfall arises when the customer's Exposure (Principal Outstanding + Interest Overdue) exceeds DP. Shortfall management is a critical risk control function. Today it is broken in several ways that affect borrowers, the operations team, and the business's risk posture. **Who is affected:** - Borrowers who act in good faith — making repayments or pledging additional collateral — are being penalised because their recovery actions are netted against same-day market movements, stripping them of the ageing benefit they earned - Operations team who manually approve shortfall communications every morning, creating a bottleneck that prevents borrowers from receiving timely notice before markets open - Risk team who have no automated early-warning on severe collateral deterioration until it is too late to act same-day - LSPs who cannot offer a good borrower experience because the shortfall API doesn't expose due dates or the full picture of shortfall types **What is broken today — six specific gaps:** 1. **Ageing is not fair to borrowers.** The incremental shortfall is computed as a single net figure mixing market movements (ΔDP) and customer actions (ΔExposure). A borrower who repays ₹1L on a day the market falls ₹1.2L gets zero ageing benefit — the repayment is silently absorbed. Data shows this is material: across accounts in shortfall, 12% of borrowers at ageing 1 made repayments, 7.8% at ageing 2, 8.6% at ageing 3 — these customers deserved ageing credit that the current logic denies them. 2. **Shortfall does not run on non-market days.** When T is a market holiday, the shortfall job skips T+1 entirely. Borrowers who repaid on the holiday stay in shortfall on the platform for an extra day even though their account is clean — a bad experience with no financial basis. 3. **Interest overdue is excluded from Exposure.** Current shortfall logic only uses Principal Outstanding. RBI regulations require Exposure to be POS + Interest Overdue. This means shortfall is understated today. 4. **No reliable NAV gate.** The shortfall job and the NAV update

## #73 — Suspension framework
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?

Currently, suspensions or blacklisting actions (triggered by screening alerts, loan irregularities, or risk assessments) are handled inconsistently across different systems and entities within the NBFC. This fragmented approach creates several critical issues:

1. **Inconsistent Enforcement**: Different systems apply suspension logic differently, leading to gaps where suspended entities can still transact through certain channels
2. **`Missing Hierarchy Propagation**: When a customer is flagged at PAN level, the suspension doesn't automatically cascade to their existing leads,

## #80 — Transaction Sequencing & Transaction Workflows for
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**In scope:**
This document defines the **transaction orchestration logic across all supported transaction types**.

Specifically it covers:

# Transaction Sequencing & Transaction Workflows for Co-Lending LMS Last Edited: March 19, 2026 9:44 PM PRD ETA: March 10, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora # Background and Context DSP Finance is implementing a **co-lending structure between DSP and TCL** where a single customer loan is operationally represented by **three loan accounts inside the LMS**. The loan accounts are structured as follows: - **Loan 100** → Customer facing orchestration loan (Finflux) - **Loan 90** → TCL lender loan (Swiffy LMS) - **Loan 10** → DSP lender loan (Finflux) All **customer-facing interactions and repayments occur on Loan 100**, while lender accounting and settlement must be reflected in the **individual lender loan books**. This PRD introduces the need for **systematic orchestration across multiple loan books** to ensure: - lender accounting reconciliation - schedule consistency - correct split of repayments - ransaction ordering - correct DP (Drawing Power) management --- ### Transaction Categories The system processes two categories of transactions. --- ## Money Transactions These impact loan balances or receivables. Examples: - Disbursement - Repayment - Refund / Disbursement reversal - Charge application - Charge knock off - Interest posting - Credit note adjustments - Waivers - Excess payment handling - Excess refunds - Clear dues transactions --- ## Collateral Transactions These impact collateral and **DP calculations**. Examples: - Add collateral - Remove collateral - Sell-off collateral Collateral operations may also **trigger money transactions**, such as: - Margin pledge charges - Invocation charges - Repayment from sell-off proceeds --- # Current Challenge The LMS currently processes transactions **independently per loan account** without orchestration across lender books. This introduces several operational risks in a co-lending structure. --- ## 1. Transaction Ordering Risk Example sequence: Repayment → Interest posting → Charge posting If these are processed **in different orders across lender loan books**, the share calculations become inconsistent. --- ## 2. Money Flow vs Accounting Mismatch Customer funds move through **escrow accounts**, while lender receivables are maintained in the LMS. Without deterministic orchestration: - escrow balances may move - lender books may not reconcile --- ## 3. Collateral and Money Transaction Race Conditions Example: Sell-off collateral and repayment arriving simultaneously. This may result in: - incorrect DP recalculation - incorrect sell-off triggers - incorrect available limit. --- ## 4. Partial Transaction Failures Example: Loan 100 disbursement succeeds but lender loan posting fails. This creates **partial system states** that break reconciliation. --- # Why Solving This

## #84 — [Platform] Decoupling of dishonour fees with manda
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently our dishonour charge application is coupled with mandate presentation, what that means is basis certain error codes that we get from Digio (presentation vendor), we either apply or do not apply dishonour charges

However that leaves the following gap, for customers where mandate was not registered, and presentation does not happen, we are not able to apply dishonour charges (which should have been applied).

How does scenarios arise where mandate is not registered for the user:

- User revokes existing mandate (cancels)
- User registers via Aadhaar Esign or Physica

**Solution:**
?**

We will be setting up a job on Finflux which will apply dishonour charges (Rs 590 - - 500 + GST) to users with interest overdue on the 8th of next month (Interest for January was posted on 1st Feb and was due on 7th Feb, dishonour fees if applicable will be posted on 8th Feb at 2 AM)

We will remove charge application logic from our mandate presentation workflow, mandate presentation will only post or not post transactions based on the status received from the vendor (extendable to current implementation with PhonePe)

## #85 — [Platform] Disbursement optimisation to handle cro
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As an NBFC one of the core aspects is to handle disbursements. Disbursement as a request as primarily two main components:

- Payout from the source bank account to the beneficiary bank account
- Posting of the transaction in the loan account of the user

While it seems pretty straightforward, there are multiple aspects that affect this workflow:

- Charge posting and knock off from disbursement requests
- Disbursement reversals

More about payouts:

Now payouts primarily have two cycles, debit cycle where the money is debited from the source bank account (NBFC bank account)

**Solution:**
?**

When a payout for a disbursement request placed in the previous billing cycle with a successful SOA posting in the previous billing cycle fails in the next billing cycle.

Change 1: Instead of reversing the payout as well as the corresponding knock off entry, we will be doing a partial return of the SOA posting.

Change 2: When a user places a withdrawal request, as a part of the workflow, we first knock off the charges, and then initiate the payout (sometimes it takes time for us to get confirmation on the payout cycle and the debit cycle in itself can fail) can cause similar instances as described in the problem statement where we are unable to reverse the charge knock off transaction post billing cycle

## #86 — [Platform] Foreclosure handling to support Volt fo
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

A loan account has the following particulars:

- Charges due
- Penal charges due
- Interest due
- Principal oustanding
- Interest accrued not due
- Excess

Whenever a user makes a repayment, it goes through a set apportionment strategy:

Interest overdue → Charges overdue → Interest due → Charge due → Principal outstanding → Excess

Note that the repayments cannot settle interest accrued as it is not due, interest accrued is posted at the end of the billing cycle (becomes due) and then can be settled either via making repayments or via mandate presentation to the user’s loan

**Solution:**
?**

We will allow the LSP to pass an optional parameter called (Is foreclosure payment) in the create repayment order request.

<aside>
🚨

Please note that we will not be validating the amount (and if it satisfies foreclosure validations) for the account

</aside>

For this repayments, there will be an additional step in the payment workflow for the following validation:

- If Excess amount ≥ Accrued interest and TOS=0, clear dues
- If Excess amount < Accrued interest or TOS≠0 then do not clear dues

<aside>
⚠️

Please note that these payments will not go through a checker approval workflow

## #87 — [Platform] Mandate collection enhancement
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Our LAMF credit line product follows a balloon repayment model, which essentially means that the customer is only obligated to pay the interest as per their principal outstanding (which is accrued daily and posted monthly). 

There are multiple ways through which a user can pay this amount:

- Making a repayment on their lo ch the NBFC automatically deducts the amount from the user’s bank account)

What amount is collected from the user’s account?

- Charges due + Penal charges due + Interest due are collected on the 7th via mandate presentation

As we are a platform, there 

**Solution:**
?**

We will be enhancing our current mandate presentation workflow to support the use case where an LSP will control the mandate presentation for the users and will have the following capabilities:

- Get mandate collection file: Mandate collection file which is generated every month and then approved by the operations team will be available as a file (csv) through a get API (for all eligible loan accounts for presentation) to the LSP with approval status
- Mandate collection posting API: LSP will have the capability to pass the mandate collection response to the user (broadly there can be the following scenarios)
    - Mandate was presented and collected successfully (Success)
    - Mandate was presented but failed (Fail)
    - Mandate was not presented (Pending) - LSP will not call the

## #88 — Term Loan Apportionment Logic
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Apportionment Logic - Apportionment is the distribution of a paid sum of money across multiple components of a loan/tranche in order to knock off/settle these components. - Apportionment logic will be based in the order of IPC. - In case of a single tranche apportionment the order will be: Interest Overdue>Principal Overdue>Interest Due>Principal Due>Charge. In case there are multiple EMIs of the Tranche which are overdue then apportionment will start from the oldest EMI overdue. - In case of multiple tranches apportionment the order will be: Oldest EMI overdue(Interest>Principal)>Oldest EMI due(Interest>Principal)>Charges. In case of EMIs overdue across multiple tranches the oldest EMI across tranches will be apportioned first then the apportioning will be done for the next oldest EMI across the tranches and so on so forth. In case all the overdue EMIs are cleared/apportioned the next apportioning will be done for the oldest due EMI and once the oldest due EMI is apportioned then apportioning of the next oldest due EMI will be done and so on so forth. Once all the overdue and due EMIs are apportioned across tranches, apportionment of charges will start and it will also be done based in the order of the oldest charge getting apportioned first i.e. in the chronological order. - If after the apportionment of all the components there is an excess which remains then we will ask the user to select the tranche wherein the excess will be adjusted. The excess adjustment will happen in a way that either the Tenure of the Tranche is reduced or the EMI of the Tranche is reduced based on the user’s selection. Default option(in case user does not select) will always be to reduce the tenure keeping the EMI same for the oldest Tranche.

## #92 — Term Loan DPD handling
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: DPD handling ## **Handling of Days Past Dues (DPD) for Overdue Tranches** ### **Definition of DPD** - **Days Past Due (DPD)** is the number of calendar days an EMI remains unpaid beyond its scheduled due date. - DPD shall be calculated **per tranche/EMI** and maintained at both: - **Tranche level** → to identify overdue EMIs. - **Loan account level** → to reflect overall delinquency status. --- ### **DPD Lifecycle & Tracking** - **0 DPD:** EMI due on the due date but not yet paid. - **1–13/18 DPD:** Period after the due date until the 2nd Mandate presentation. - **14/19 DPD onwards:** If the 2nd NACH also bounces, account enters persistent delinquency. - Post sell-off, if dues are cleared, DPD for corresponding tranches resets to **0**. - If sell-off proceeds are **insufficient**, DPD continues to accrue on residual overdue balance. --- ### **DPD & Apportionment Interaction** - When sell-off proceeds are received: 1. First, they are applied to the **oldest overdue tranche (highest DPD)**. 2. Within a tranche, proceeds are apportioned as: - Interest component → Principal component → Charges. 3. Once all overdue tranches are cleared, any remaining proceeds are applied towards: - Upcoming EMIs (not yet due), then - Loan-level excess balance. --- ### **DPD in Customer Communication(To be closed)** - Customer statements and notifications shall explicitly display: - Current DPD status per tranche. - Total overdue amount by DPD bucket (e.g., 1–30 days, 31–60 days). - Post-sell-off DPD reset (or residual overdue if sell-off insufficient). --- ### **Regulatory & Credit Bureau Reporting** - DPD values shall be reported to credit bureaus as per regulatory guidelines (CIBIL/Experian/Equifax). - If overdue persists beyond sell-off (due to insufficient collateral proceeds), the updated DPD must continue until full settlement. - Correct mapping of **tranche-level DPD → loan-level delinquency** must be ensured in reporting systems. --- ### **Exception Handling** - If AMC redemption is delayed (T+1/T+2), DPD continues to accrue until proceeds are actually realized. - In case of system error or partial sell-off, DPD is adjusted retrospectively once final proceeds are credited.

## #93 — Term Loan Disbursement
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Disbursement ### First Drawdown Based on the Submit opportunity status the subsequent flow will be decided: **Submit Opportunity Failure:** - Loan and Tranche Account won’t be created and LSP will have to re-trigger the request **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Success):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. - Our payout partner acknowledges the request and initiate the payout from their end. - Once the amount gets debited from our bank account we get a debit success response. - Post the debit from our Bank Account the amount will get credited to the customer’s bank account. This is when we get a credit success response. - Once we receive a credit success response we will be posting the disbursal in the ledger and accordingly a Tranche account will be opened. - Based on the disbursal amount, tenure and interest rate the repayment/EMI schedule gets generated. **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Failure):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. There are multiple scenarios once the disbursal/payout request is triggered from our systems: 1. The request is not triggered resulting in an instant failure of the disbursement. In such a case we need to retry initiating the request until it gets triggered to the Payout partner. 2. The request is triggered from our system but due to the Payout partner system being down we get an error resulting in disbursement failure. In such a case we need to re-trigger the request at the same time we receive the error from our payout partner or we can wait for sometime before re-triggering the request. 3. The request is received by the payout partner and the same is acknowledged through a response but the debit from our bank account does not happen and we get a debit failure response. In such a case we need to re-trigger the disbursal request(Depends on tech handling, if we are not able to handle this in V0 then we can mark the disbursal as failure and inform the LSP of the same for them to re-trigger the request and we unblock

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, all repayments (via VA or PG) can result in excess funds being received from the borrower due to multiple reasons such as pre payments, duplicate transactions, or rounding differences.

Without a clear and automated excess handling logic, this can lead to:

- Incorrect allocation of payments across tranches or dues.
- Customer confusion and complaints regarding refund timelines.
- Operational inefficiencies due to manual intervention in refund processing.
- Incorrect accounting treatment if prepayment or refund rules are not consistently applied.

## #98 — Term Loan Manual Repayments(VA)
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Customers rely on LSP app or automated mandate flows for repayments. However, some customers may want to make repayments directly to DSP (e.g., via bank transfer). There is no simple mechanism for customers to pay directly outside the LSP ecosystem.

Without a Virtual Account (VA) option:

- Customers lack flexibility in repayment methods.
- Ops team faces reconciliation challenges for direct transfers.

**Solution:**
?**

Enable repayments via static Virtual Accounts (VA) mapped per customer. Customers can transfer funds directly to DSP, and the repayment will be posted in the Loan Management System (LMS) with appropriate apportionment, re-amortisation, or foreclosure handling.

## #99 — Term Loan Prepayments and Excess Handling
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
Are We Solving?**

- Customers need to be provided with an option to pay their EMIs as and when they want in order to avoid higher delinquencies and bad customer experience.
- Customers needs a structured way to prepay specific tranches/EMIs in their term loans.
- This creates customer dissatisfaction, potential regulatory risk, and inefficient fund management for the lender.
- Without proper foreclosure/prepayment support, customers may:
    - Face higher effective interest costs.
    - Avoid early repayment, reducing lender’s portfolio efficiency.

## #100 — Term Loan Sell off
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
Are We Solving?**

- When customers miss repayment obligations / goes into shortfall / goes into high risk category, the lender faces credit risk exposure and delayed recovery of dues.
- Without a transparent process, collateral liquidation may lead to:
    - Operational inefficiencies.
    - Customer disputes regarding how proceeds are applied.
    - Regulatory compliance gaps.
- There is a need for a standardized, rule-based collateral sell-off mechanism to ensure timely recovery and clear apportionment of proceeds

## #101 — Term Loan Unpledge Eligibility API(Post loan creat
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, LSPs do not have visibility into how much of a customer’s pledged portfolio is eligible for unpledging at any given point in time.

When users initiate an unpledge request through the LSP interface, they may encounter errors or rejections if:

- The requested unpledge amount exceeds the eligible limit (based on outstanding loan value, haircut, or margin requirements)

This leads to:

- Poor user experience — users get rejected after attempting unpledge.
- Increased operational load — repeated support queries and failed attempts.
- Inefficient system calls — LSPs m

**Solution:**
?**

We will provide an Eligibility API for Unpledging that LSPs can call before initiating an unpledge request. The API will return aggregate eligibility (amount-wise) for the LSP to inform to their customers on their app. The eligible amount based on which the user will be able to unpledge their funds will be calculated as detailed below:

$Maximum Unpledge Eligible Amount = Drawing Power - Principal Dues - Interest Dues - Outstanding Loan Principal(Not due) -  Outstanding Interest for Upcoming EMI across all Tranches(Not Due) + Total Excess$

The API we need to provide will include the following mandatory parameter:

loanAccountId

The response we need to provide based on the API call will include the following mandatory parameters:

loanAccountId
maxUnpledgeEligibleAmount

## #102 — Term Loan Unpledging
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Unpledging **Pre Loan A/C creation:** 1. If user pledges their collateral but does not proceed with the loan account creation then after 90 days from pledging we will initiate unpledging of the collaterals. The unpledging of the collaterals will be an Ops driven process. 2. If before 90 Days, user reaches out to us to unpledge their collateral instead of going ahead with the loan account creation then Ops will initiate the unpledge on the customer’s request. Customer won’t bear any charge(In V0) for getting their collaterals unpledged. In both the above cases the Ops process remains the same as OD. Ops team will be uploading the collateral unpledge file(Data team will be providing the collateral file to Ops) through the Bulk Upload option on the Command Centre. There won’t be any change in the file type, processing of the bulk upload and further process executions for unpledging of collaterals related to Term Loans. **Post Loan A/C creation:** - Loan Foreclosure: In case user Forecloses the Loan then the unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow same as it is currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. - If customer forecloses all the tranches before the expiry of the Facility/Loan tenure, we won’t initiate the collateral unpledging automatically. - If customer takes the first drawdown and closes/cancels the tranche during the Cool-off period then we won’t be unpledging the collaterals automatically until loan foreclosure or Facility(Loan) tenure expiry. Post Cool-off tranche cancellation three cases arise: 1. Customer proceeds to foreclose the Loan: Unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow as currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. 2. Facility/Loan Tenure expires: This has currently not happened for OD product as well and no process is in place currently. Hence not a part of V0, we can take this up in V2. 3. Customer requests for collateral unpledging from LSP: If there is a Loan level outstanding then the flow is discussed in Partial Unpledging. If there is no Loan level outstanding then the user will be able to select the fund/s they want to unpledge and raise the request for the same(User can raise the unpledging request either in one go or in multiple times). Once the user raises the unpledge request/s through the LSP to DSP it will either go through the STP or nSTP flow, described below. - Partial Unpledging: Customers can only initiate partial

# Discussion with Rohan (Groww) 1. Building in-house after 1 year of operations is recommendable instead of building it in-house from the start 2. VideoSDK has good solution for the video session. 3. Groww built all the in-house cause they were aiming for 4. Hyperverge gives a high amount of false negatives 5. Initially: Success rate → 80% and VKYC completion rate → 70% 6. After spending 2 quarters improving on the Vkyc stack, Success rate → 95% and VKYC completion rate → 80% 7. It is important to store the data correctly and in a reproducible manner. 8. IDfy and Digio are recommended VKYC solution providers 9. Digio uses VideoSDK for their video stack - confirmed 10.

Such processes complying with prescribed standards and procedures shall be treated on par with face-to-face CIP for the purpose of this Master Direction." > ### **Risk Classification:** - **High Risk designation** for customers until face-to-face KYC completion within 2 years - **VKYC serves as alternative** to in-person verification for borrowal accounts - **Debit restrictions** apply for high risk customers if KYC is not updated every 2 years ### **Documentation Requirements:** - **E-PAN accepted** - no physical PAN card showcase needed - **Photo matching mandatory** - agent must verify customer photo consistency across Aadhaar/OVD and PAN/e-PAN documents ### **Timeline Compliance:** - **3 working days maximum** from initial identification information collection to VKYC completion - The customer's economic and financial profile/information must be confirmed directly with the customer during the V-CIP process - 3 way check of the face of the customer using the selfie, photo on the OVD/Aadhaar Card and the e-PAN/PAN Card - V-CIP technology infrastructure must be housed on the RE's own premises, with connections and interactions originating only from its secured network. Any outsourced technology must comply with RBI guidelines. For cloud deployments, data ownership must remain solely with the RE, and all data—including video recordings—must be immediately transferred to the RE's owned or leased servers after V-CIP completion. Cloud service providers or third-party technology vendors must not retain any data from the V-CIP process. - ###
