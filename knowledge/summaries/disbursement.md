## 🟢 LATEST — Bank Account Verification for Disbursement in TATA
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** September 6, 2024 7:57 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- For users whose loans are processed with TATA and who have multiple bank accounts stored with the lender, the Volt’s system picks the first bank account for sending disbursement request to the lender.
- Discrepancies occurs between the lender's records and Volt's database regarding a customer's bank account information due to lack of verification process during the account updation using admin tool.

---

**Solution:**
?**

- We will match the bank account number and IFSC code of a customer's bank account stored in Volt's database with the bank account details stored at TATA's end before disbursal.
- This process ensures synchronisation between the two systems, allowing us to accurately identify the correct bank account for disbursement, even when TATA has multiple bank accounts stored for a user, while Volt only retains one.

## #3 — Multi Drawdown Term Loan LMS Requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** October 30, 2025 2:56 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

The existing OD-based Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) product does not align with the repayment expectations and financial behavior of a large segment of customers. These users are more familiar with **structured EMI-based repayment formats**, as seen in personal loans, home loans, and auto loans. As a result, product comprehension, drawdown confidence, and repayment discipline are negatively impacted when only an OD line is offered.

This gap is particularly visible in:

- Low drawdown rates from sanctioned limits
- Confusion around usage-based interest calculation
- Hesit

**Solution:**
?

Product Overview

We propose a **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the facility construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown.
- **Enabling multiple drawdowns** from the same facility, with flexibility in amount and tenure.
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.
- **Positioning the product clearly as “term loans with flexibility”**

This hybrid approach is designed to increase adoption, improve credit utilization, and grow customer LTV.

**Product Technical Construct**

A **line-backed, multi-drawdown term loan**, where:

- **Both loan and tranche constructs are exposed to the LSP**.
- DSP manages the **loan** as the credit container; **

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Current challenges

- Programs line Self-line, has no indication to the payout team causing them to miss the cases.
- GST payouts and Editing of the Payout  reports are manual which will create issues for schedule of payout for reports with edits
- MFDs get the report alongside the payouts, they can not keep track of payout date, and resolution the query they have raised
- We don’t create different reports for MFDs with GSTN, requiring manual work for the GSTN MFDs

Notes 

- Incorrect communication is occasionally provided to MFDs regarding their payouts.
    - data on the 

**Solution:**
?**

- We will build a table with date and report for MFD on the MFD dashboard >earnings
- MFD will have new report every month, we will mention due date
- MFD can download the payout report in a access controlled way(Email to main Email)
- We will provide a Option to add the GSTN number to MFD (optional for MFDs) and we will process there full payout + GST together.
- MFD can accept or raise issues from the dashboard, Reducing the support bandwidth
- MFD can then see status of there issues on the same dashboard.
- MFD will get steps to receive payouts like adding bank account

## #8 — [B2B2C] GST payouts and reconciliation optimisatio

**Problem:**

- Currently processing of payouts is handled manually by the business and finance team end to end, this takes up a lot of bandwidth as the payouts involve multiple back & forth for approvals till the final payment processing takes place.
- Processing GST payouts takes more than 60% of overall payout processing of the business team, as it involves manually reconciling invoices of more than 600 partners monthly, reconciling the status of the GST payout and co-ordinating with marketing team to ensure timely communications

## #12 — Single drawdown Term Loan LMS Requirements
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** August 9, 2025 11:23 AM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- **Low awareness of line-based lending products:** Most Indian consumers do not understand the concept of a reusable credit line or overdraft (OD)-style borrowing.
- **Lack of lifecycle borrowing behaviour:** Users do not engage in re-borrowing after repayment, resulting in limited customer lifetime value (LTV).

Product Overview

We propose a vanilla **term-loan-style wrapper** on top of the line construct to match user expectations and drive better usage. The solution involves:

- **Offering a familiar term-loan onboarding flow** for the first drawdown
- **Allowing re-borrowing** once limits are replenished through repayment.

**Status:** Not started | **Last edited:** April 7, 2026 11:53 AM

# PRD: Disbursement Method Selection Logic (BRE Optimization) --- # **1. Problem Statement** Currently, payout method selection (IMPS / NEFT / RTGS) is not dynamically optimized based on: - Disbursement sequence (1st vs subsequent) - Loan type (co-lending vs non co-lending) - Ticket size - Sourcing channel (e.g., CRED) This leads to: - Suboptimal payout routing - Higher costs and delays - Lack of configurability at product / contract / channel level --- ## **2. Objective** Enable a rule-based engine (BRE) to dynamically select payout method based on: - Disbursement sequence - Loan type - Amount slab - Sourcing channel --- ## **3. Scope** ### **Dimensions for Rule Evaluation** 1. **Contract type** - Co-lending - Non co-lending 2. **Sourcing Channel** - Volt - CRED (override rules) 3. **Nth Disbursement** - 1st - Subsequent 4. **Amount Slabs** - < 2 lakhs - 2–5 lakhs - 5 lakhs --- ## **4.

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- The overall SR for payouts is 99.2% and payment method wise the SR is the
    - IMPS : 99.59%
    - NEFT : 83.81 % (lower SR because these are retry attempts after IMPS failures - usually an issue at bene bank)
    - RTGS : 97. 66%
- As confirmed with Cashfree and YES Bank the SR of disbursements through NEFT is significantly higher than IMPS (Cashfree to share exact data points for this).
- Bifurcation of 0.8% disbursement failures in Apr-May

    | Beneficiary bank side decline | 138 | 46.78% |
   

**Solution:**

**Experiment 1 - Pilot NEFT as a primary payout method** 

- Objective -
    - Understand if Success Rate (SR) will increase by using NEFT
    - Settlement Time (TAT) of NEFT across business hour and non business hours
- Introduce NEFT as an alternate disbursement method to improve success rates as NEFT has a higher success rate than IMPS (as confirmed with Cashfree)
- 1st disbursement will continue to be IMPS upto 5L and RTGS >5L
- Logic for subsequent disbursements.
    - Every disbursement less the amount of ₹5 lakhs (except the first disbursement) will be routed via NEFT, since amounts above ₹5 lakhs are already handled through RTGS
- Implement a configurable flag to enable or disable NEFT routing instantly in case of any issues during the pilot.

## #15 — Unpledge and Disbursement Enhancement
**Status:** In progress | **Last edited:** April 14, 2025 8:21 PM

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, customers with pending unlien (unpledge) requests see a general disclaimer: "Unlien request in progress, withdrawals may affect the approval of your on-going unpledge request." This creates uncertainty as customers cannot determine their exact available limit until their unlien request reaches a terminal status.

---

**Solution:**
?**

I. During Unliening in process:

1. Display Precise Information 
    - Show a specific message: "Unlien request in progress, withdrawals over ₹X,XXX will affect the approval of your on-going unpledge request"
    - The ₹X,XXX represents the calculated "recommended disbursement amount" that won't interfere with the pending unlien request
2. Calculation Method for Recommended Amount
    - Calculate the active loan amount of the pending unlien funds
    - Subtract this value from the customer's current available limit
    - Present this as the safe withdrawal threshold
3. User Experience Benefits
    - Guides customers to select realistic withdrawal amounts
    - Reduces confusion and prevents unexpected withdrawal rejections
    - Provides transparent information about current account l

# Disbursement simulation - LMS Last Edited: May 22, 2026 3:49 PM PRD ETA: May 5, 2026 PRD Owner: Vaibhav Arora ## Background and Context - **Who is affected** - Borrowers using Volt (DSP Finance's LSP) who initiate withdrawal requests from their Loan Against Mutual Fund (LAMF) accounts. - All LSP partners integrated with DSP Finance's disbursement infrastructure. - DSP Finance's Risk Operations team, who are exposed to collateral shortfall risk when disbursements breach the safe limit. - **What is broken today** - The current Available Limit calculation — `AL = min(DP, SL) - POS + EM` does not account for accrued interest, charges, or scenarios where non-principal exposure grows to exceed the margin held against collateral. Two specific scenarios expose DSP Finance to risk: - **Case 1 — Collateral Removal:** After a borrower repays principal and requests maximum collateral removal, the remaining collateral may only cover the Drawing Power. Any subsequent withdrawal creates a situation where accrued interest (once booked as Interest Due) pushes total exposure above collateral value. - **Case 2 — Voluntary Sell-off:** After a sell-off settles principal, the sell-off proceeds inflate Excess Money, which inflates the Available Limit. A borrower can withdraw this excess, creating a POS that, combined with accrued interest becoming due, exceeds the remaining collateral value. - Today, the Loan Detail API value is trusted by all downstream systems (Fenix, Volt, and LSP partners) as the authoritative available limit. There is no pre-disbursement validation layer that applies the updated risk-safe AL formula before funds are transferred. - **Why it matters** - Collateral shortfall represents direct credit risk for DSP Finance — in cases of default, outstanding dues cannot be fully recovered. - The gap grows over time as accrued interest compounds, making early intervention critical. - LSP partners rely on the available limit shown to borrowers; without a simulation gate, disbursements that breach exposure limits will be processed without any check. --- ## 1. Problem Scope ### In scope - Building a new Disbursement Simulation API that computes the risk-safe maximum withdrawal amount using the updated AL formula. - Updating the Volt (LSP) frontend to call the Disbursement Simulation API between the 'Enter Withdrawal Amount' screen and the 'Confirm Amount' screen. - Graceful borrower communication on Volt when the entered amount exceeds the simulation limit — showing the maximum allowed amount and enabling re-entry. - API design contract documentation to be shared with

## #19 — [Platform] Disbursement optimisation to handle cro
**Status:** Completed | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

As an NBFC one of the core aspects is to handle disbursements. Disbursement as a request as primarily two main components:

- Payout from the source bank account to the beneficiary bank account
- Posting of the transaction in the loan account of the user

While it seems pretty straightforward, there are multiple aspects that affect this workflow:

- Charge posting and knock off from disbursement requests
- Disbursement reversals

More about payouts:

Now payouts primarily have two cycles, debit cycle where the money is debited from the source bank account (NBFC bank account)

**Solution:**
?**

When a payout for a disbursement request placed in the previous billing cycle with a successful SOA posting in the previous billing cycle fails in the next billing cycle.

Change 1: Instead of reversing the payout as well as the corresponding knock off entry, we will be doing a partial return of the SOA posting.

Change 2: When a user places a withdrawal request, as a part of the workflow, we first knock off the charges, and then initiate the payout (sometimes it takes time for us to get confirmation on the payout cycle and the debit cycle in itself can fail) can cause similar instances as described in the problem statement where we are unable to reverse the charge knock off transaction post billing cycle

Scenario 1:

## #29 — Payouts Phase 2
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Payouts Phase 2 Issues 1. 1. **Uncertain Base Transaction Data:** Due to challenges in maintaining updated transaction tables with lender APIs, the ETA for receiving accurate base transaction data is unpredictable, often delaying payouts. This process needs to be initiated at the beginning of each month. 2. 2. **Commercials in Credit Application:** The Analytics team has noted difficulties due to the absence of commercials as a parameter in credit applications. Currently commercials for Platforms and Base are hardcoded 3. 3. **GST Invoice Generation:** There is no structured process for GST invoice creation, causing partners to send ad hoc invoices, which are frequently inaccurate, leading to approval delays. 4. 4. **Unmapped Transactions:** Approximately 20k transactions lack a mapped recipient, creating further reconciliation challenges. 5. 5. **Lack of Accessible MFD Account Balance Data:** We do not have comprehensive account balance data, affecting accurate calculations. We need to provide better Partner level account visibility to the Support team and platforms. 6. 6. **HSBC Reconciliation Process:** The current reconciliation process with HSBC could be improved due to unrelated transactions in the account. 7. 7. **Dedicated Support for Payout Issues:** There is no dedicated team member or specific contact for payout-related queries or a dedicated email portal for these issues. 8. 8. **Ad-hoc payments:** There were ad-hoc payments based on partner requests without the required details to be reckoned. 9. 9. **Communication challenges:** In past we have shared Comms with wrong Details to the Partners raising a lot of tickets and Current commission statement could be better.Proposed Phase 1 Solution: GST Invoicing Process Tasks identified - Document the current table creation process end to end - Review and identify bugs and callout limitations - Parter commercials to be moved to a config instead of the a hardcoded values - Resolve 20k Unmapped trasctions - get a more accurate count - find and resolve the audit challanges - Build DB for the balance amounts - HSBC API integration - Dedication individual for Payouts - with accounts and Data background - Build communication Scripts inhouse and have the team Other challanges - - Currently all the process after tables is on Puneets personal laptop and is very risky. we don’t have any backup - We need to move to just supporting the Email channel for payouts and payouts related query.

## #33 — Term Loan Apportionment Logic
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Apportionment Logic - Apportionment is the distribution of a paid sum of money across multiple components of a loan/tranche in order to knock off/settle these components. - Apportionment logic will be based in the order of IPC. - In case of a single tranche apportionment the order will be: Interest Overdue>Principal Overdue>Interest Due>Principal Due>Charge. In case there are multiple EMIs of the Tranche which are overdue then apportionment will start from the oldest EMI overdue. - In case of multiple tranches apportionment the order will be: Oldest EMI overdue(Interest>Principal)>Oldest EMI due(Interest>Principal)>Charges. In case of EMIs overdue across multiple tranches the oldest EMI across tranches will be apportioned first then the apportioning will be done for the next oldest EMI across the tranches and so on so forth. In case all the overdue EMIs are cleared/apportioned the next apportioning will be done for the oldest due EMI and once the oldest due EMI is apportioned then apportioning of the next oldest due EMI will be done and so on so forth. Once all the overdue and due EMIs are apportioned across tranches, apportionment of charges will start and it will also be done based in the order of the oldest charge getting apportioned first i.e. in the chronological order. - If after the apportionment of all the components there is an excess which remains then we will ask the user to select the tranche wherein the excess will be adjusted. The excess adjustment will happen in a way that either the Tenure of the Tranche is reduced or the EMI of the Tranche is reduced based on the user’s selection. Default option(in case user does not select) will always be to reduce the tenure keeping the EMI same for the oldest Tranche.

## #35 — Term Loan Communications
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Customers availing a **Term Loan under Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF)** must have timely, contextual, and transparent communication regarding their loan lifecycle.

- Customers often don’t receive clarity on loan disbursement, repayment schedules, EMI due dates, tranche-level updates, and closure status.
- Absence of structured communication increases inbound queries to customer support, delays repayments, and lowers customer trust.
- Regulatory and compliance requirements mandate that lenders provide customers with certain communications (e.g., SOA, NOC, repayment reminde

**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Customers availing term loans against mutual funds will want to have a clear visibility of their **collateral, loan obligations, tranche-level details, and closure status**. These statements will help in solving the below:

- Customer confusion on pledged securities and their valuation.
- Lack of transparency around principal outstanding, EMI dues, and charges at the loan and tranche level.
- Difficulty in obtaining official proof of loan closure (No Dues Certificates).
- Increased customer support queries and operational overhead for servicing teams.

We need a standardized

**Solution:**
?**

We will design and deliver **five standard customer statements** for the Term Loan Against Mutual Funds product in V0:

1. **Holding Statement**
    - We will be providing this to the customer so that they are informed about their Holdings with us.
2. **Statement of Accounts (Loan and Tranche)**
    - These documents will help the customer with an understanding about their Dues and transactions.
3. **Loan and Tranche No Dues Certificates (NOC) - Loan and Tranche**
    - When a Loan or a Tranche is closed/foreclosed we will be providing these statements.

Documents which CRED shares with their customers in their current product:

At loan level:

- sanction letter
- ⁠holding document

At each Tranche level:

- Loan agreement
- ⁠ key fact statement

If Tranche is closed

- NOC docum

## #37 — Term Loan DPD handling
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: DPD handling ## **Handling of Days Past Dues (DPD) for Overdue Tranches** ### **Definition of DPD** - **Days Past Due (DPD)** is the number of calendar days an EMI remains unpaid beyond its scheduled due date. - DPD shall be calculated **per tranche/EMI** and maintained at both: - **Tranche level** → to identify overdue EMIs. - **Loan account level** → to reflect overall delinquency status. --- ### **DPD Lifecycle & Tracking** - **0 DPD:** EMI due on the due date but not yet paid. - **1–13/18 DPD:** Period after the due date until the 2nd Mandate presentation. - **14/19 DPD onwards:** If the 2nd NACH also bounces, account enters persistent delinquency. - Post sell-off, if dues are cleared, DPD for corresponding tranches resets to **0**. - If sell-off proceeds are **insufficient**, DPD continues to accrue on residual overdue balance. --- ### **DPD & Apportionment Interaction** - When sell-off proceeds are received: 1. First, they are applied to the **oldest overdue tranche (highest DPD)**. 2. Within a tranche, proceeds are apportioned as: - Interest component → Principal component → Charges. 3. Once all overdue tranches are cleared, any remaining proceeds are applied towards: - Upcoming EMIs (not yet due), then - Loan-level excess balance. --- ### **DPD in Customer Communication(To be closed)** - Customer statements and notifications shall explicitly display: - Current DPD status per tranche. - Total overdue amount by DPD bucket (e.g., 1–30 days, 31–60 days). - Post-sell-off DPD reset (or residual overdue if sell-off insufficient). --- ### **Regulatory & Credit Bureau Reporting** - DPD values shall be reported to credit bureaus as per regulatory guidelines (CIBIL/Experian/Equifax). - If overdue persists beyond sell-off (due to insufficient collateral proceeds), the updated DPD must continue until full settlement. - Correct mapping of **tranche-level DPD → loan-level delinquency** must be ensured in reporting systems. --- ### **Exception Handling** - If AMC redemption is delayed (T+1/T+2), DPD continues to accrue until proceeds are actually realized. - In case of system error or partial sell-off, DPD is adjusted retrospectively once final proceeds are credited.

## #38 — Term Loan Disbursement
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Disbursement ### First Drawdown Based on the Submit opportunity status the subsequent flow will be decided: **Submit Opportunity Failure:** - Loan and Tranche Account won’t be created and LSP will have to re-trigger the request **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Success):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. - Our payout partner acknowledges the request and initiate the payout from their end. - Once the amount gets debited from our bank account we get a debit success response. - Post the debit from our Bank Account the amount will get credited to the customer’s bank account. This is when we get a credit success response. - Once we receive a credit success response we will be posting the disbursal in the ledger and accordingly a Tranche account will be opened. - Based on the disbursal amount, tenure and interest rate the repayment/EMI schedule gets generated. **Submit Opportunity Success(Disbursal Failure):** - Loan Account is created and Disbursement workflow is triggered. - Once the Disbursement workflow is triggered we will block the DP of the user. - The Disbursement/Payout request is then sent to our Payout partner. There are multiple scenarios once the disbursal/payout request is triggered from our systems: 1. The request is not triggered resulting in an instant failure of the disbursement. In such a case we need to retry initiating the request until it gets triggered to the Payout partner. 2. The request is triggered from our system but due to the Payout partner system being down we get an error resulting in disbursement failure. In such a case we need to re-trigger the request at the same time we receive the error from our payout partner or we can wait for sometime before re-triggering the request. 3. The request is received by the payout partner and the same is acknowledged through a response but the debit from our bank account does not happen and we get a debit failure response. In such a case we need to re-trigger the disbursal request(Depends on tech handling, if we are not able to handle this in V0 then we can mark the disbursal as failure and inform the LSP of the same for them to re-trigger the request and we unblock

## #39 — Term Loan Excess Handling and Refund
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, all repayments (via VA or PG) can result in excess funds being received from the borrower due to multiple reasons such as pre payments, duplicate transactions, or rounding differences.

Without a clear and automated excess handling logic, this can lead to:

- Incorrect allocation of payments across tranches or dues.
- Customer confusion and complaints regarding refund timelines.
- Operational inefficiencies due to manual intervention in refund processing.
- Incorrect accounting treatment if prepayment or refund rules are not consistently applied.

We aim to design

## #40 — Term Loan Foreclosure
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

For Borrowers:

•	Interest burden: Reduces overall interest paid over the loan/tranche tenure.

•	Debt-free sooner: Achieves financial freedom earlier than planned.

•	Flexibility: Allows reallocation of capital or freeing up of credit limits.

For Lender/Business:

•	Reduces credit risk: Full repayment eliminates the risk of future defaults.

•	Recycling capital: Frees up capital for new disbursements, improving portfolio turnover.

## #41 — Term Loan Mandate Repayments
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

- **Collections Reliability:**
    
    In Term Loans, fixed EMI dates require timely collections. Manual payments or ad-hoc transfers are prone to delays, user forgetfulness, and operational leakage.
    
- **Operational Efficiency:**
    
    Manual chasing of repayments increases Ops load, costs, and NPA risk.
    
- **Customer Experience:**
    
    Users don’t want to remember EMI dates or perform repetitive actions each month. Mandates automate this and prevent missed-payment penalties.
    
- **Regulatory Alignment:**
    
    NPCI/NACH mandates ensure collections hap

## #42 — Term Loan Manual Repayments(PG)
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

For Borrowers:

•	Multiple payment options: Cards, UPI, netbanking, etc.

•	On-demand payments: Can make ad-hoc part-payments, overdue clearance, or foreclosure instantly.

•	Better experience: Real-time confirmation and receipts. 

•	Convenience: Removes friction of doing manual transfers for loan repayment.

For Lenders:

•	Improved collections efficiency: Easier for customers to pay resulting in fewer missed EMIs.

•	Faster settlement: PGs provide quick transaction processing.

•	Reduced operational cost: Less manual reconciliation vs cheque/DD payments.

•	Scalable: Hand

## #43 — Term Loan Manual Repayments(VA)
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Customers rely on LSP app or automated mandate flows for repayments. However, some customers may want to make repayments directly to DSP (e.g., via bank transfer). There is no simple mechanism for customers to pay directly outside the LSP ecosystem.

Without a Virtual Account (VA) option:

- Customers lack flexibility in repayment methods.
- Ops team faces reconciliation challenges for direct transfers.

---

**Solution:**
?**

Enable repayments via static Virtual Accounts (VA) mapped per customer. Customers can transfer funds directly to DSP, and the repayment will be posted in the Loan Management System (LMS) with appropriate apportionment, re-amortisation, or foreclosure handling.

## #44 — Term Loan Prepayments and Excess Handling
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
Are We Solving?**

- Customers need to be provided with an option to pay their EMIs as and when they want in order to avoid higher delinquencies and bad customer experience.
- Customers needs a structured way to prepay specific tranches/EMIs in their term loans.
- This creates customer dissatisfaction, potential regulatory risk, and inefficient fund management for the lender.
- Without proper foreclosure/prepayment support, customers may:
    - Face higher effective interest costs.
    - Avoid early repayment, reducing lender’s portfolio efficiency.

## #45 — Term Loan Sell off
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
Are We Solving?**

- When customers miss repayment obligations / goes into shortfall / goes into high risk category, the lender faces credit risk exposure and delayed recovery of dues.
- Without a transparent process, collateral liquidation may lead to:
    - Operational inefficiencies.
    - Customer disputes regarding how proceeds are applied.
    - Regulatory compliance gaps.
- There is a need for a standardized, rule-based collateral sell-off mechanism to ensure timely recovery and clear apportionment of proceeds

## #46 — Term Loan Unpledge Eligibility API(Post loan creat
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

**Problem:**
are we solving?**

Currently, LSPs do not have visibility into how much of a customer’s pledged portfolio is eligible for unpledging at any given point in time.

When users initiate an unpledge request through the LSP interface, they may encounter errors or rejections if:

- The requested unpledge amount exceeds the eligible limit (based on outstanding loan value, haircut, or margin requirements)

This leads to:

- Poor user experience — users get rejected after attempting unpledge.
- Increased operational load — repeated support queries and failed attempts.
- Inefficient system calls — LSPs m

**Solution:**
?**

We will provide an Eligibility API for Unpledging that LSPs can call before initiating an unpledge request. The API will return aggregate eligibility (amount-wise) for the LSP to inform to their customers on their app. The eligible amount based on which the user will be able to unpledge their funds will be calculated as detailed below:

$Maximum Unpledge Eligible Amount = Drawing Power - Principal Dues - Interest Dues - Outstanding Loan Principal(Not due) -  Outstanding Interest for Upcoming EMI across all Tranches(Not Due) + Total Excess$

The API we need to provide will include the following mandatory parameter:

loanAccountId

The response we need to provide based on the API call will include the following mandatory parameters:

loanAccountId
maxUnpledgeEligibleAmount

## #47 — Term Loan Unpledging
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# Term Loan: Unpledging **Pre Loan A/C creation:** 1. If user pledges their collateral but does not proceed with the loan account creation then after 90 days from pledging we will initiate unpledging of the collaterals. The unpledging of the collaterals will be an Ops driven process. 2. If before 90 Days, user reaches out to us to unpledge their collateral instead of going ahead with the loan account creation then Ops will initiate the unpledge on the customer’s request. Customer won’t bear any charge(In V0) for getting their collaterals unpledged. In both the above cases the Ops process remains the same as OD. Ops team will be uploading the collateral unpledge file(Data team will be providing the collateral file to Ops) through the Bulk Upload option on the Command Centre. There won’t be any change in the file type, processing of the bulk upload and further process executions for unpledging of collaterals related to Term Loans. **Post Loan A/C creation:** - Loan Foreclosure: In case user Forecloses the Loan then the unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow same as it is currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. - If customer forecloses all the tranches before the expiry of the Facility/Loan tenure, we won’t initiate the collateral unpledging automatically. - If customer takes the first drawdown and closes/cancels the tranche during the Cool-off period then we won’t be unpledging the collaterals automatically until loan foreclosure or Facility(Loan) tenure expiry. Post Cool-off tranche cancellation three cases arise: 1. Customer proceeds to foreclose the Loan: Unpledging request will go through the non-STP flow as currently happening in OD Loan Foreclosure. 2. Facility/Loan Tenure expires: This has currently not happened for OD product as well and no process is in place currently. Hence not a part of V0, we can take this up in V2. 3. Customer requests for collateral unpledging from LSP: If there is a Loan level outstanding then the flow is discussed in Partial Unpledging. If there is no Loan level outstanding then the user will be able to select the fund/s they want to unpledge and raise the request for the same(User can raise the unpledging request either in one go or in multiple times). Once the user raises the unpledge request/s through the LSP to DSP it will either go through the STP or nSTP flow, described below. - Partial Unpledging: Customers can only initiate partial

## #48 — MFD Payout Calculation Automation
**Status:** Unknown | **Last edited:** Unknown

# MFD Payout Calculation Automation **Introduction** Volt currently manages payout calculations for its Direct Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs) through a highly manual process involving multiple Google Sheets, individual SQL queries, and significant analyst effort. This process is prone to errors, lacks scalability, presents a business continuity risk due to analyst dependency, and lacks clear auditability. This document outlines the requirements for building an automated, robust, and scalable Payout Calculation Engine to address these challenges specifically for Volt Direct MFDs. This engine will serve as the foundation for improving the overall payout experience, ensuring accuracy, timeliness, and transparency. 1. we need to handle changing factors like - Monthly Transactions table - Marketing Offers /Referral bonuses - New Platforms additions - Changes in commercials with existing platforms /partners - Changes in base rates / Format - Negotiations with MFDs 2. We need to be able to audit how an amount was generated 3. we need to be able to accrue the credits to an account based on the activity 4. We need to have the DB that is specific to transactions i.e we can't modify or delete the transactions that have happened, we can only rollback Problem statements Before base payout calculations - Delay in updating transaction table due to TATA API rate limits. We can’t differentiate the New transactions so we have download from beginning , this process currently take 3 days and growing. - We have to reconcile missing Credit applications between transaction table and second data source, currently this process is manual and second data source is not reliable. - Attribution of customer to correct Platfrom and partner require manual intervention. - We don’t store the PF and ROI paid by the customer in Credits table. - Commercials on transactions are added from the Partner commercials sheet manually, we don’t store share and Rates with the Credit application Data adding steps to calculate the payouts After the Base payout calculation - TDS rules change and have to accommodate - GST payout are tracked manually Payout process - Tracking payout transactions Reconciliation takes 4 (2+2) days with HSBC - For Platform Payouts we need to provide a statement and how the Payout amount is calculated. - Partners have a hard time understanding statements. Potential solutions - Get TATA to improve the API data provided to get the updated transactions - Better fall-back handling on our side Activity activity triggers a
